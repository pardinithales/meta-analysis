  "Female_Percentage": "30.8 (16/52)",
  "Other_Demographics": "80% younger than 20 years",
  "Headache_Percentage": "Not reported",
  "Focal_Seizures_Percentage": "Treatment: 92% (48% simple partial, 44% with secondary generalization), Control: 89% (37% simple partial, 52% with secondary generalization)",
  "Other_Symptoms": "Perilesional edema in all patients (mild 64-67%, moderate 33-36%)",

  "Praziquantel_Dose": "Not used",
  "Corticosteroid_Type": "IV methylprednisolone 1.0g/1.72m2/day",
  "Antiepileptic_Drug": "Phenytoin or carbamazepine monotherapy",
  "Follow_up_Duration_Months": "9",
  "Imaging_Schedule": "Baseline and 2 months",
  "Complete_Resolution_Percentage": "60% methylprednisolone vs 18.5% control at 2 months (p=0.001)",
  "Partial_Resolution_Percentage": "40% methylprednisolone vs 81.5% control had unresolved/partially resolved lesions",
  "No_Change_Percentage": "Not directly specified",
  "Seizure_Reduction_Percentage": "Recurrence: 16% methylprednisolone vs 33% control (p=0.20)",

  "Comments": "IV methylprednisolone significantly improved lesion resolution at 2 months but did not significantly affect seizure recurrence. Seizure recurrence was associated with lesion persistence in 75% of cases in both groups.",
