  "Headache_Percentage": "Not reported",
  "Focal_Seizures_Percentage": "73 (90/124)",
  "Other_Symptoms": "83% had seizures with generalization",
  "Treatment_Type": "ABZ+PZQ vs high-dose ABZ vs standard ABZ, all with dexamethasone",
  "Albendazole_Dose": "15 mg/kg/day (standard), 22.5 mg/kg/day (high-dose)",

  "Comments": "Combined ABZ+PZQ showed superior cyst resolution vs standard ABZ (p=0.014), particularly in patients with >3 cysts. Complete cyst resolution associated with significant reduction in seizure frequency.",
