  "Follow_up_Duration_Months": "30",
  "Imaging_Schedule": "MRI at 6 months, CT at 12 and 24 months",
  "Complete_Resolution_Percentage": "At 6 months: 21/57 (36.8%) in albendazole group vs 8/59 (13.6%) in placebo group were free of active lesions",

  "Comments": "Albendazole showed significant reduction in generalized seizures and faster cyst resolution. Treatment was safe with mild side effects. Benefits outweighed theoretical risks of treatment.",
