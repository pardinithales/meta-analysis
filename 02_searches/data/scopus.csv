An albendazole course at 30 mg/kg/day combined with corticosteroids is safe and more effective than the usual dose. A single treatment was insufficient in intraventricular and giant cysts.

However, despite its frequent manifestation, some findings, such as cognitive impairment and dementia, remain poorly understood. Less commonly, NCC may affect the ventricular system and subarachnoid spaces and this form is known as extraparenchymal neurocysticercosis. A particular presentation of the subarachnoid form is called racemose cysticercosis, which has a progressive pattern, frequently leads to hydrocephalus and can be life-threatening. Here we review a case of the racemose variety of cysticercosis, complicated by hydrocephalus and reversible dementia, with remission of symptoms after derivation and that remained stable with use of dexchlorpheniramine.

Among the neurological sequelae of NC, seizures have been described as the most common symptom. Acute symptomatic seizures often result from degeneration of a viable cyst; however, not all of these patients with acute or provoked seizures will develop epilepsy (i.e., recurrent unprovoked seizures). Because of the high prevalence of epilepsy and NC, a causal, as well as incidental relationship between the two may exist. The epileptogenicity of calcified cysts as well as the potential association between NC and hippocampal sclerosis necessitates future research. Antihelminthic treatment of NC results in disappearance of viable cysts in about one-third of patients with parenchymal disease, but a reduction in seizure recurrence has not been demonstrated in randomized controlled trials. Prevention is critical to reduce the burden of seizure and epilepsy related to NC.","Cysticercosis; Parasitic; Seizure; Taenia solium","Anthelmintics; Epilepsy; Female; Humans; Male; Neurocysticercosis; Prognosis; Recurrence; Seizures; Treatment Outcome; albendazole; anthelmintic agent; carbamazepine; phenytoin; praziquantel; article; calcification; computer assisted tomography; disease eradication; DNA polymorphism; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; epilepsy; epileptogenesis; hippocampal sclerosis; human; immune response; immunological tolerance; meta analysis (topic); neurocysticercosis; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; prevalence; prognosis; randomized controlled trial (topic); recurrent disease; seizure","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84901285635"

However, data on the treatment outcome of a long course of this drug is scarce. This study aims to investigate the efficacy and safety of three 30-day courses of albendazole in patients with neurocysticercosis. Materials and methods. The diagnosis of neurocysticercosis was based on epidemiological, clinical and laboratory criteria as guided by the Vietnamese Ministry of Health. Sixty patients with a mean age of 50.17±10.03 years old, with 86.7% (95% CI: 77.8–95.5%) men, were involved in this study. Patients received three 30-day courses of albendazole with an intermittence of 20 days. Additional treatment included steroids, anticonvulsants or analgesics. Based on brain magnetic resonance imaging 6 months after the therapy, the efficacy was classified as cure (viable cysts not discernible), improvement (50% or more cysts disappeared or calcified) or inefficacy (changes in less than 50% of the cysts). The safety was determined based on the changes of biochemical parameters after each treatment course. Results. The most common clinical presentations were headache (90.0%, 95% CI: 82.2–97.8) and/ or seizure (68.3%, 95% CI: 56.2–70.4), followed by other symptoms such as fainting, memory loss, and limb numbness. Active cysts were discovered in all cases and located mainly in the parenchymal region. After therapy, the rates of cure, improvement or inefficacy were 43.3% (95% CI: 30.4–56.2%), 51.7% (95% CI: 38.7–64.7%) and 5.0% (95% CI: 0–10.7%), respectively. Liver enzymes were slightly higher compared to those before therapy and mostly returned to normal ranges after drug interruption. Alanine aminotransferase levels before the 3rd course were higher than values before the first and second courses. No abnormalities in blood urea or creatinine after therapy were reported.

Three 30-day cycles of albendazole appear to have good efficacy and tolerability in patients with neurocysticercosis. © Sinh C.T. et al., 2022.","albendazole; efficacy; long course; neurocysticercosis; safety","alanine aminotransferase; albendazole; analgesic agent; anticonvulsive agent; aspartate aminotransferase; praziquantel; steroid; adult; aged; alanine aminotransferase level; amnesia; antiparasitic therapy; Article; clinical examination; cyst; drug efficacy; drug safety; faintness; female; headache; human; hypertransaminasemia; limb; major clinical study; male; multiple cycle treatment; neurocysticercosis; neuroimaging; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; paresthesia; prospective study; seizure; treatment duration; treatment outcome; vomiting","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85147750666"

We undertook a prospective cohort study to look into the seizure patterns and incidence of recurrence in association with two of the most common causes of RELs after gradually stopping AEDs at least 18 months after acheiving seizure control. Methods: Ninety patients with neurocysticercosis (NCC) and twenty-nine patients with tuberculoma were treated with anti-helminthic and anti-tubercular drugs according to current recommended guidelines, and followed up for a minimum of 2 years after the last seizure free day. In every patient included in the study, AEDs were tapered within six months of attaining a seizure-free interval of 18 months. We looked at the incidence of recurrent seizures after stopping AEDs in both groups of patients. Results: The frequency of baseline seizures (2.1 vs 1.5 per year, p < 0.001) and number of antiepileptic drugs (2.12 vs 1.48, p < 0.001) were greater in patients with NCC than those with tuberculoma. Patients with NCC had a greater incidence of recurrent seizures (1.17 vs 0.07 in the next six months, p < 0.001) after stopping the AEDs. The median interval to seizure recurrence after stopping AEDs was 2.2 months in patients with NCC. Conclusions: Among RELs, NCC lesions have a greater epileptogenic potential than tuberculomas. AEDs can be tapered in patients with tuberculoma after a seizure free period of 18 months with a very low risk of recurrence. © 2020","Antiepileptics; Neurocysticercosis; Seizure; Tuberculoma","Adult; Anthelmintics; Anticonvulsants; Antitubercular Agents; Female; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Neurocysticercosis; Prospective Studies; Recurrence; Seizures; Tuberculoma, Intracranial; Young Adult; anthelmintic agent; anticonvulsive agent; tuberculostatic agent; anthelmintic agent; anticonvulsive agent; tuberculostatic agent; adult; Article; cohort analysis; controlled study; epilepsy; female; human; incidence; intracranial tuberculoma; major clinical study; male; neurocysticercosis; priority journal; prospective study; recurrence risk; treatment withdrawal; complication; diagnostic imaging; intracranial tuberculoma; neurocysticercosis; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; recurrent disease; seizure; young adult","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85082759964"

It is a major cause of epileptic seizures in low- and middle-income countries. Corticosteroids are frequently used to reduce inflammation and perilesional edema. We aimed to evaluate their efficacy for reducing the rate of seizures and lesion persistence in imaging studies. Methods: We searched randomized controlled trials in Medline, Central, EMBASE, LILACS, and the gray literature without language restrictions. We assessed eligibility, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias in the included studies. The main outcomes included seizure recurrence and lesion persistence on imaging studies at 6-12 months of follow-up. Risk ratios (RR) were used for evaluating the main outcomes. Results: Thirteen studies involving 1373 participants were included. The quality of the evidence was deemed low to very low. Corticosteroids alone versus placebo/no drug (five trials) reduced the rate of seizure recurrence at 6-12 months (RR 0.46, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.27-0.77; 426 participants) and the persistence of lesions in imaging studies (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.43-0.92; 417 participants). No differences were noted in other comparisons, including the use of corticosteroids and albendazole combined. Corticosteroids plus albendazole increased the risk of abdominal pain, rash, and headaches (odds ratio 8.73, 95% CI 2.09-36.5; 116 participants, one trial). Conclusions: Although the evidence suggest corticosteroids can reduce the rate of seizure recurrence and speed up resolution of lesions at 6-12 months of follow-up, there remains uncertainty on the effect estimate due to a high risk of methodological and publication bias. More adequately performed randomized trials that evaluate the use of anthelmintics, corticosteroids, and both combined against placebo are needed. © 2013 International Society for Infectious Diseases.","Cysticercosis; Glucocorticoids; Neurocysticercosis; Taenia solium","albendazole; corticosteroid; dexamethasone; placebo; praziquantel; prednisolone; abdominal pain; article; drug efficacy; follow up; headache; human; neurocysticercosis; rash; recurrent disease; seizure","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84891371208"

Many factors can contribute to the endemic nature of cysticercosis. The inflammatory process that occurs in the tissue surrounding the parasite and/or distal from it can result from several associated mechanisms and may be disproportionate with the number of cysts. This discrepancy may lead to difficulty with the proper diagnosis in people from low endemic regions or regions that lack laboratory resources. In the CNS, the cysticerci have two basic forms, isolated cysts (Cysticercus cellulosae = CC) and racemose cysts (Cysticercus racemosus = CR), and may be meningeal, parenchymal, or ventricular or have a mixed location. The clinical manifestations are based on two fundamental syndromes that may occur in isolation or be associated: epilepsy and intracranial hypertension. They may be asymptomatic, symptomatic or fatal; have an acute, sub-acute or chronic picture; or may be in remission or exacerbated. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) may be normal, even in patients with viable cysticerci, until the patients begin to exhibit the classical syndrome of NCC in the CSF, or show changes in one or more routine analysed parameters. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have allowed non-invasive diagnoses, but can lead to false negatives. Treatment is a highly controversial issue and is characterised by individualised therapy sessions. Two drugs are commonly used, praziquantel (PZQ) and albendazole (ABZ). The choice of anti-inflammatory drugs includes steroids and dextrochlorpheniramine (DCP). Hydrocephalus is a common secondary effect of NCC. Surgical cases of hydrocephalus must be submitted to ventricle-peritoneal shunt (VPS) immediately before cysticidal treatment, and surgical extirpation of the cyst may lead to an absence of the surrounding inflammatory process. The progression of NCC may be simple or complicated, have remission with or without treatment and may exhibit symptoms that can disappear for long periods of time or persist until death. Unknown, neglected and controversial aspects of NCC, such as the impaired fourth ventricle syndrome, the presence of chronic brain oedema and psychic complaints, in addition to the lack of detectable glucose in the CSF and re-infection are discussed. © 2011 Bentham Science Publishers.","Clinical manifestations; Diagnosis; Epidemiology; Incidence; Neurocysticercosis; Prophylaxis; References; Treatment","albendazole; antiinflammatory agent; dexchlorpheniramine; praziquantel; steroid; acute disease; article; brain ventricle peritoneum shunt; chronic disease; computer assisted tomography; Cysticercus; Cysticercus cellulosae; cysticercus racemosus; disease course; disease exacerbation; epilepsy; fatality; human; hydrocephalus; intracranial hypertension; neurocysticercosis; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; reinfection; remission; Taenia","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84855787355"

As albendazole therapy is controversial, these patients need to be treated initially with anti epileptic drug (AED) and it may be withdrawn when follow- up CT scan shows resolution of the lesion. Seizures due to calcified lesions should be treated with AED for 2 years. Persistent, symptomatic lesions need to be treated with cysticidal drugs and those lesions of > 20 mm should be investigated for tuberculous infection and treated appropriately.","Neurocysticercosis; Seizures; Single enhancing CT lesion; Tuberculoma","","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-72349085295"

Treatment with either praziquantel or albendazole has suboptimum efficacy. We aimed to establish whether combination of these drugs would increase cysticidal efficacy and whether complete cyst resolution results in fewer seizures. We added an increased dose albendazole group to establish a potential effect of increased albendazole concentrations. Methods: In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial, patients with viable intraparenchymal neurocysticercosis were randomly assigned to receive 10 days of combined albendazole (15 mg/kg per day) plus praziquantel (50 mg/kg per day), standard albendazole (15 mg/kg per day), or increased dose albendazole (22·5 mg/kg per day). Randomisation was done with a computer generated schedule balanced within four strata based on number of cysts and concomitant antiepileptic drug. Patients and investigators were masked to group assignment. The primary outcome was complete cyst resolution on 6-month MRI. Enrolment was stopped after interim analysis because of parasiticidal superiority of one treatment group. Analysis excluded patients lost to follow-up before the 6-month MRI. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00441285. Findings: Between March 3, 2010 and Nov 14, 2011, 124 patients were randomly assigned to study groups (41 to receive combined albendazole plus praziquantel [39 analysed], 43 standard albendazole [41 analysed], and 40 increased albendazole [38 analysed]). 25 (64%) of 39 patients in the combined treatment group had complete resolution of brain cysts compared with 15 (37%) of 41 patients in the standard albendazole group (rate ratio [RR] 1·75, 95% CI 1·10-2·79, p=0·014). 20 (53%) of 38 patients in the increased albendazole group had complete cyst resolution at 6-month MRI compared with 15 (37%) of 41 patients in the standard albendazole group (RR 1·44, 95% CI 0·87-2·38, p=0·151). No significant differences in adverse events were reported between treatment groups (18 in combined treatment group, 11 in standard albendazole group, and 19 in increased albendazole group). Interpretation: Combination of albendazole plus praziquantel increases the parasiticidal effect in patients with multiple brain cysticercosis cysts without increased side-effects. A more efficacious parasiticidal regime without increased treatment-associated side-effects should improve the treatment and long term prognosis of patients with neurocysticercosis.

Method This is an interventional study conducted at Upendra Devkota Memorial National Institute of Neurological and Allied sciences, Bansbari over 1 year (2017 March-2018 February). One hundred eighteen patients with new onset seizure secondary to active solitary cysticercal granuloma either received albendazole therapy for 1, 3, 9 or 21 days with the usual care or only received the usual care. Clinical and radiological outcomes were observed at one month follow-up. The difference in the proportion of the outcome measures between intervention and control groups were assessed using chi-square test. Result Our study included 118 patients with male predominance of 61.9%. Albendazole therapy for 3, 9 and 21 days reduced headache by 57.2%, 70.0% and 63.1% respectively which was higher than those with 1-day therapy or without the therapy. This difference in the proportion was statistically significant at p=0.001. Though seizure recurrence also declined but the difference was not significant (p=0.406) between groups. However, at one-month follow-up, majority of patients who received albendazole for 9 days (14, 70%) and 21 days (14, 73.7%) had normal lesion, while most calcified lesion (21, 67.7%) was observed in those who did not receive albendazole therapy. The difference between lesion among the groups was significant (p < 0.001). Conclusion Albendazole therapy in patients with active solitary neurocysticercosis for 9 days is as effective as 21 days and better than 3 days in headache control and lesion dissolution but seizure control could be achieved irrespective of the treatment. © 2022, Kathmandu University.

Acute symptomatic seizures, the main clinical manifestation of parenchymal neurocysticercosis, are caused by the host brain immune-inflammatory process in response to the death or degenerative phase of the parasite. Seizures may recur over the course of several months while the local inflammatory activity lasts. If the seizures recur once the acute process resolves, the patient can be diagnosed as having epilepsy. However, most acute symptomatic seizures secondary to neurocysticercosis do not evolve to epilepsy. Recent prospective studies suggest that the development of epilepsy, while more common than in the general population, is not as common in neurocysticercosis patients as originally suggested by cross-sectional studies. Antiparasitic treatment has been found to hasten the transition of cysts from the active phase to the degenerative phase and is associated with a short-term reduction in focal seizures after treatment. However, antiparasitic treatment has not been found to affect the transition from the degenerative phase to calcification, which is an epileptogenic substrate associated with subsequent epilepsy. In this narrative review, we critically appraise the relationship among neurocysticercosis, seizures, and epilepsy in the context of new developments in the literature. © 2021 British Epilepsy Association","Antiparasitic drugs; Epilepsy; Epileptogenesis; Neurocysticercosis; Prognosis; Seizures","Brain; Cross-Sectional Studies; Epilepsy; Humans; Neurocysticercosis; Seizures; Article; blood brain barrier; brain calcification; comorbidity; computer assisted tomography; disease association; epilepsy; epileptogenesis; follow up; granuloma; headache; human; intracranial hypertension; medical research; neurocysticercosis; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; population research; probability; prognosis; propensity score; prospective study; recurrent disease; risk factor; seizure; solitary cysticercus granuloma; World Health Organization; brain; complication; cross-sectional study; diagnostic imaging; epilepsy; neurocysticercosis; seizure","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85101220612"

The presentation of the disease is dependent on both the immunological response of the host against the parasite as well as the location of the encysted organisms within the central nervous system (CNS). The principles of management utilized for intraparenchymal disease cannot be applied to extraparenchymal NCC. An advance in management of intraparenchymal NCC, the most common form encountered by physicians, is the use of both albendazole and praziquantel as a treatment strategy. Patients with subarachnoid NCC (SANCC) require months of treatment with both an antiparasitic agent and steroids to avoid complications such as hydrocephalus and vascular events during treatment. The determinants of successful treatment in SANCC have not been established, but response to therapy can be determined by evaluating several endpoints related to disease evolution including radiographic changes, serum antigen, and CSF antigen. Intraventricular NCC is primarily a surgical disease and data supports minimally invasive endoscopic removal of cysts in many of these patients. NCC is increasingly recognized in non-endemic countries due to increased immigration making it important for physicians to become familiar with the management of this disease. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Central nervous system infection; Cysticercosis; Helminthic infection; Hydrocephalus; Neurocysticercosis; Taenia solium; Tapeworm infection","albendazole; praziquantel; steroid; Article; brain ventricle; clinical feature; diffusion weighted imaging; human; minimally invasive surgery; neurocysticercosis; spinal cord; subarachnoid space; treatment indication; treatment response","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84910660222"

The role of antiparasitic (albendazole) therapy for seizure control and resolution of lesions is still controversial due to a lack of adequately controlled studies. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the role of albendazole therapy for neurocysticercosis patients with two or more lesions to achieve seizure-free status and resolution of lesions. This was a randomised controlled study in which patients suffering from neurocysticercosis were prospectively followed up for more than 5 years (from January 1997 to January 2005). Patients were divided into two groups: patients in group A (n = 150) were treated with a combination of tapered doses of dexamethasone and albendazole, plus antiepileptic drugs; patients in group B (n = 150) were treated with antiepileptic drugs plus a placebo control. Patients were followed up every month for the first 6 months and then at 3-month intervals thereafter up to 5 years. Variables of interest were (i) recurrence of seizures; (ii) encephalopathy (headache/vomiting/altered sensorium); (iii) need for subsequent hospital admission; (iv) death; (v) resolution of lesions on follow-up CT. During the first 6 months and at intervals thereafter, increased seizure frequency and hospital readmissions, and increased incidence of encephalopathy were observed in group A (p = 0.01), and two patients in this group died with intractable seizures and encephalopathy. A greater proportion of lesions completely resolved in group B (p = 0.05), whereas a greater proportion of lesions calcified in group A (p = 0.05). Albendazole plus antiepileptic drugs did not have greater beneficial effects than antiepileptic drugs alone, but may have an adverse effect with respect to seizure control, encephalopathy, recurrent hospital admissions, calcification of lesions and cost of treatment. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The QOLIE-31 questionnaire was applied before the onset of anti-parasitic treatment. The associations between QOLIE-31 scores, sociodemographic characteristics, clinical, and neuroimaging data were analyzed with Kruskal–Wallis test and generalized linear models (GLM). Results: The average QOLIE-31 score was 55.8 (SD ± 7.6), with 119 individuals (76.8%) scoring in the poor quality-of-life category. Generalized tonic-clonic seizures and secondarily generalized epileptic seizures were associated with a lower QOLIE-31, as well as a low level of education with a value of p = 0.05. There were no associations between QOLIE-31 scores and other variables such as sex, age, antiepileptic medication, number of parasitic cysts, and number of compromised brain regions. On multivariate analysis, a greater number of generalized epileptic seizures maintained a statistically significant association with detrimental QOLIE-31 scores. Conclusion: Quality of life is affected in NCC, mainly in relation to the number of prior generalized epileptic seizures. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","Cysticercosis; Epilepsy; Neurocysticercosis; Peru; QOLIE-31 score; Quality of life","Cross-Sectional Studies; Epilepsy; Humans; Neurocysticercosis; Quality of Life; Seizures; Surveys and Questionnaires; albendazole; praziquantel; adolescent; adult; aged; antiparasitic therapy; Article; brain region; computer assisted tomography; cross-sectional study; education; epilepsy; epileptic patient; female; human; Kruskal Wallis test; major clinical study; male; neurocysticercosis; neuroimaging; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; Peruvian; QOLIE-31 score; quality of life; questionnaire; scoring system; complication; diagnostic imaging; epilepsy; neurocysticercosis; quality of life; seizure","FIC-NIH; Fogarty International Center, FIC, (D43TW001140)","This work was partially supported by FIC-NIH Training Grant D43TW001140.

Intracranial neurocysticercosis is classified into cerebral parenchymal and extraparenchymal forms (subarachnoidal and intraventricular). Current medical therapy for parenchymal and extra parenchymal neurocysticercosis invovles the use of anticysticercal drugs. Albendazole and praziquantel are two commonly used drugs. Most experts prefer to always use oral or parenteral corticosteroids along with anticysticercal drugs. The role of anticysticercal drugs in the treatment of parenchymal neurocysticercosis has always been a subject of intense controversy. Whether therapy with anticysticercal drugs results in improved seizure-related prognosis remains a major concern. A recent meta-analysis evaluating six controlled trials suggests that treatment with anticysticercal drugs results in better resolution of colloidal and vesicular cysticerci; in patients taking anticysticercal drugs, there was a lower risk of seizure reccurence in patients with colloidal cysticerci and a significant reduction in the rate of generalized seizures in patients with vesicular cysticerci. However, the findings of the study by Carpio et al. have revived the controversy regarding this treatment. These authors noted that the effect of a single dose of albendazole is, at best, only modest. Only a minority of patients with parenchymal neurocysticercosis benefitted and became cyst free and there was a lack of effectiveness toward the associated seizure disorders. No response was seen in patients with degenerative parenchymal or extra parenchymal forms of neurocysticercosis. Carpio et al. suggest that there is a need for further studies that employ different approaches, such as the use of high initial doses of albendazole, the use of two anticysticercai drugs or repeated prolonged courses of albendazole. © 2008 Expert Reviews Ltd.","Albendazole; Antiepileptic drug; Cysticercosis; Epilepsy; Granuloma; Headache; Neurocysticercosis; Praziquantel","albendazole; anticonvulsive agent; carbamazepine; corticosteroid; dexamethasone; methotrexate; phenytoin; placebo; praziquantel; prednisolone; article; brain disease; clinical feature; clinical trial; cysticercosis; drug dose reduction; drug fatality; drug induced headache; drug megadose; drug substitution; drug withdrawal; follow up; headache; human; hydrocephalus; intracranial hypertension; low drug dose; multiple cycle treatment; neurocysticercosis; neurologic disease; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; seizure; single drug dose; stomach disease; Taenia solium; unspecified side effect","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-55249125464"

Parenchymal brain infection can cause symptoms from mass effect that include headache, seizures, confusion, and even coma. Our objective was to describe the clinical course of neurocysticercosis infections in pregnant women.METHODS:This was a case series that described clinical findings and pregnancy outcomes of women diagnosed with neurocysticercosis from 1994 through 2016 at a single institution. Their medical records were reviewed, cranial computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging scans were assessed, and the infections were classified according to the criteria of the 2018 Infectious Diseases Society of America and the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene.RESULTS:Overall, 37 pregnant women with neurocysticercosis were identified. Of the 37 women, 32 were symptomatic, and 16 each had severe headaches or new-onset seizures or other neurologic sequelae. Some of these women had multiple symptoms. Others were diagnosed when neuroimaging was done for a history of neurocysticercosis or evaluation of a preexisting seizure disorder. The most common treatment was with anthelmintics-albendazole, praziquantel, or both-usually given with anticonvulsants and corticosteroids to decrease inflammation. There were eight women in whom invasive neurosurgical procedures were performed, usually for hydrocephaly. Overall, 32 healthy neonates were born at term, and there was one preterm delivery at 34 weeks of gestation. The four pregnancy losses included two molar pregnancies, one anembryonic miscarriage, and a 23-week stillbirth of a pregnancy complicated by preeclampsia with severe features.CONCLUSION:Neurocysticercosis in pregnant women may be asymptomatic or result in headaches, seizures, confusion, nausea and vomiting, altered mental status, or obtundation. Anthelmintic treatment is usually successful, but in some women neurosurgical procedures are necessary to relieve obstructive hydrocephaly. © 2022 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Methods: One hundred forty-eight subjects presenting with new-onset seizures (<15 days duration) and with SCG demonstrated on imaging studies were randomly allocated to either treatment with prednisolone (40-60 mg/day for 2 weeks) or placebo in addition to standard antiepileptic drug therapy. The subjects were followed up for seizure recurrence for 9 months. Repeat computed tomography (CT, at 3 months) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI, at 6 months) to evaluate resolution and calcification of the lesion. Key Findings: There was no difference in the proportion of subjects with seizure recurrence during the follow-up period in the treatment (n = 16, 21.9%) and control (n = 19, 25.33%) groups (p = 0.7). However, generalized seizures occurred in a significantly lesser proportion of subjects in the treatment group (n = 3, 15.79%) in comparison to the control group (n = 12, 60.00%) (p = 0.015). There were no significant differences in the proportion of subjects with complete resolution of the SCG on repeat CT at 3 months [treatment group (27, 46.7%) and control group (23, 39.8%); p = 0.453] and repeat MRI at 6 months [treatment group (28, 46.7%) and control group (21, 38.9%); p = 0.402]. Significance: The administration of a short course of prednisolone does not offer significant improvement in seizure control, although a benefit in terms of reducing the likelihood of generalized seizures is possible. Furthermore, it does not improve the chances of resolution of the SCG on follow-up imaging studies. © 2011 International League Against Epilepsy.","Corticosteroids; Neurocysticercosis; Prednisolone; Seizures; Solitary cysticercus granuloma","Adolescent; Adult; Double-Blind Method; Female; Glucocorticoids; Granuloma; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Neurocysticercosis; Prednisolone; Seizures; Treatment Outcome; Young Adult; placebo; prednisolone; adolescent; adult; article; clinical article; computer assisted tomography; controlled study; double blind procedure; female; grand mal epilepsy; grand mal seizure; granuloma; human; male; neurocysticercosis; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; priority journal; randomized controlled trial; recurrent disease; solitary cysticercus granuloma; treatment duration; treatment response","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-80053576114"

The disease occurs when humans become intermediate hosts of the tapeworm Taenia solium after ingesting its eggs by contagion from an asymptomatic Taenia carrier. Within the nervous system, parasites may locate in brain parenchyma, subarachnoid space, ventricular system, or spinal cord, causing several pathological changes that are responsible for the clinical pleomorphism of the disease. Seizures are the most common clinical manifestation, but a sizable proportion of patients develop focal deficits, intracranial hypertension, or cognitive decline. Preoperative diagnosis of neurocysticercosis is possible after proper integration of data from neuroimaging studies and immunological tests. Cysticidal drugs (albendazole and praziquantel) have changed the prognosis of most patients with neurocysticercosis. The use of these drugs has shown to reduce the parasite load within the central nervous system and to improve the clinical prognosis of the disease in many cases. Future studies should focus on disease eradication through the implementation of control programs against all the interrelated steps in the life cycle of T solium, including human carriers of the adult tapeworm, infected pigs, and eggs in the environment. © 2014, SAGE Publications.

Praziquantel (PZQ) is one of the antiparasitics mostly used in managing NCC, however, there have been only a few studies on the treatment outcome of this drug. The present study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of PZQ in patients with NCC. Sixty patients with typical characteristics of NCC received three 10-day cycles of PZQ and the interruption between these cycles was 10 days. Additional treatment included antiinflammation (steroids), antiepileptics and analgesics. Clinical and imaging studies were done at baseline and six months after therapy to assess the efficacy of treatment. Laboratory evaluation was done before and after each cycle to investigate laboratory safety profiles. By six months after finishing therapy, all patients had clinical improvement and 75% of them were free of symptoms. The rates of complete, partial or no resolution of cysts on brain magnetic resonance imaging were 61.7%, 28.3% and 10% respectively. The efficacy of therapy was not associated with the number of cysts. There was no difference between the levels of aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, urea and creatinine before and after treatment.

The disease presents with a variety of clinical presentations from focal to diffuse neurological symptoms. Despite being an endemic country, there are no studies describing the clinico-epidemiological characteristics of NCC in Mozambique. Herein, we describe a consecutive cases series of NCC from the national reference Hospital in Maputo, capital of Mozambique. Methods: Consecutive cases of NCC diagnosed during a 3-year period (January/2020–December/2022) were retrieved from the institutional clinical files and imaging database. Results: Six cases of NCC were identified, with mean age of 43.1 years (range 26–66). Four were males (66.6 %). The median time from the beginning of clinical manifestations to the diagnosis was 6 months (range 3–18 months). All patients presented with severe parenchymal NCC, with seizures (n = 5, 83 %) being the most common manifestation. Other clinical manifestations were dementia (n = 1) and hydrocephalus (n = 1). The imaging showed multiple lesions at different stages, with half (n = 3) of them showing the coexistence of nodular calcified lesions at earlier stages (vesicular, colloidal and granular stages). Patients were treated with anthelminthic drugs, corticosteroids and anticonvulsants and no deaths to report. The 3rd month modified Rankin scale was ≤ 2 in 83 % of patients. Conclusion: In our case series, patients with NCC presented very late, with severe advanced stage disease, with multiple coexistent short and long-term brain lesions. These findings can be explained eventually because of the Maputo Central Hospital being national referral center receiving commonly more severe cases. Studies aiming to clarify the diagnosis pathways/barriers and NCC awareness among medical doctors working at primary and secondary health care level is mandatory to assess the real burden of NCC and implement timely diagnosis and care of patients affected by this neglected disease. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Mozambique; Neurocysticercosis; Sub-Saharan Africa; “Diagnosis delay”","albendazole; anthelmintic agent; anticonvulsive agent; carbamazepine; corticosteroid; dexamethasone; phenytoin; praziquantel; prednisolone; adult; aged; Article; clinical article; clinical feature; dementia; epileptic state; female; headache; hospital; human; hydrocephalus; male; middle aged; Mozambique; neurocysticercosis; neurosurgery; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; Rankin scale; seizure; social status","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85166908602"

Plasma levels of albendazole sulfoxide (ASOX), the active metabolite of albendazole, are highly variable among patients. We hypothesized that high ASOX plasma levels during albendazole therapy may be associated with an increased antiparasitic efficacy. Methods: ASOX plasma levels were measured at treatment day 7 in 118 patients with parenchymal NCC enrolled in a treatment trial. The relationships between increasing ASOX plasma levels with the proportion of cysts resolved and the proportion of patients with complete cyst resolution (evaluated by 6-month brain magnetic resonance) were assessed. Results: There was a trend toward a higher proportion of cysts resolved and a higher proportion of patients cured with increasing quartiles of ASOX plasma levels. In patients with 3 or more brain cysts, the regression analysis adjusted by the concomitant administration of praziquantel (PZQ) showed a 2-fold increase in the proportion of cysts resolved (risk ratio [RR], 1.98; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.01-3.89; P =. 048) and 2.5-fold increase in the proportion of patients cured (RR, 2.45; 95% CI,. 94-6.36; P =. 067) when ASOX levels in the highest vs the lowest quartile were compared. No association was found in patients with 1-2 brain cysts. Conclusions: We suggest an association between high ASOX plasma levels and increased antiparasitic efficacy in patients with parenchymal NCC. Nonetheless, this association is also influenced by other factors including parasite burden and concomitant administration of PZQ. These findings may serve to individualize and/or adjust therapy schemes to avoid treatment failure. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

Many of these infectious diseases can affect the nervous system directly or indirectly. The contemporary neurologist should therefore be cognizant of the clinical manifestations, potential complications, and appropriate management of common travel-related infections. This chapter focuses on five important infections that affect the central nervous system and that may be encountered in returning travelers: Japanese encephalitis, malaria, rabies, dengue, and neurocysticercosis. The clinical manifestations, suggested evaluation, and treatment are discussed for each infection.

Taenia solium (Ts), the larval form of the pig tapeworm, is the primary cause of the preventable and eradicable zoonotic parasitic disease Cysticercosis (Ct), which is primarily observed in individuals residing in underdeveloped nations. However, because to unregulated migration and globalization, the number of carriers in wealthy nations is steadily rising. In this investigation, we seek to learn more about the pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric symptoms in individuals suffering from Neurocysticercosis (NPNCC). Drug development strategies aimed at targeting ferropanoptosis in NCC are promising. Potential therapeutic approaches include: Iron chelators: Compounds that sequester iron ions, reducing their availability for catalyzing lipid peroxidation and subsequent cell death. Antioxidants: Substances that counteract lipid peroxidation and oxidative stress, thereby protecting neurons from ferroptotic damage. Lipid peroxidation inhibitors: Molecules that inhibit the enzymatic pathways involved in lipid peroxidation, preventing neuronal membrane damage. Combination therapies: Synergistic approaches combining iron chelators with antioxidants or lipid peroxidation inhibitors to maximize neuroprotective effects. Recent advances in understanding ferropanoptosis and its role in NCC highlight the potential for personalized medicine approaches tailored to individual patient profiles and disease stages. Future research should focus on clinical trials to validate the efficacy and safety of these novel therapeutic strategies, ultimately improving outcomes and quality of life for NCC patients globally. Method: Using a comprehensive search strategy, we looked for published medical subject heading (MeSH) terms such as “neurocysticercosis”, “pathophysiology of Fp/NCC”, “immunology of FPANp” OR “dysfunctional mitochondria in FPANp”, “necroptosis/apoptosis/ pyroptosis/autophagia/NCC.” Results: Peer review was conducted on all of the chosen studies, and we were unable to locate any literature discussing the pathophysiology of FPANp in NCC. Remarks and closing thoughts: We postulated that the pathophysiology of FPANp in patients with NCC is influenced by malfunctioning mitochondria, oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, Fp, and PANp. © 2024 Lourdes de Fatima Ibanez Valdes, et al.","Apoptosis; Autophagia; Cytokine storm; Drug development strategies; Dysfunctional mitochondrial; Ferroptosis; Necroptosis; Neurocysticercosis; Neuroinflammation; Oxidative stress; PANoptosis; Programmed cell death; Pyroptosis; Regulated cell death; Therapeutic approaches","caspase 3; caspase 8; ferritin; glutamate dehydrogenase; isocitrate dehydrogenase 2; phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase; protein glutamine gamma glutamyltransferase 2; ubidecarenone; voltage dependent anion channel; amino acid metabolism; apoptosis; Article; autophagy (cellular); citric acid cycle; cytokine storm; disorders of mitochondrial functions; drug development; ferropanoptosis; ferroptosis; human; immunology; lipid metabolism; lipid peroxidation; Medical Subject Headings; necroptosis; nervous system inflammation; neurocysticercosis; neurological complication; outcome assessment; oxidative stress; parasitosis; pathophysiology; peer review; prognosis; pyroptosis; quality control; quality of life; quasi experimental study; randomized controlled trial (topic); regulated cell death; signal transduction","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85204621162"

Settings and Design: A prospective observational study conducted in a tertiary care hospital. Subjects and Methods: Forty patients coming under Definitive or Probable Diagnosis of neurocysticercosis as per the revised diagnostic criteria for neurocysticercosis were included in this study. Cinical history, physical examination and neuroimaging [computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)] studies were done at the beginning. Patients were treated with albendazole, corticosteroids and antiepileptic drugs. They were followed up clinically for 3 months and neuroimaging study was repeated 3 months after albendazole therapy. Results: Definitive cases were 28 (70%) and probable cases were 12 (30%). Male:female ratio was 2.07. Mean age of 29.62 9.08 years. The commonest presentation was seizures in 38 (95%); 29 (72.5%) patients had a single lesion and 11 (27.5%) had multiple lesions in initial imaging study. Commonest site of lesion was parietal lobe (45%). Most common stage of presentation was colloidal (55%). Thirty-seven (92.5%) patients were free of seizures at the end of 3 months. At the end of 3 months, 23 (57.5%) patients had radiological resolution (complete resolution + partial resolution + calcification). Conclusions: Neurocysticercosis usually affects young persons, mostly in the third decade, being equally common among vegetarians. Most common clinical manifestation is seizures. Single lesion is more common than multiple lesions, commonly presenting in colloidal stage. Clinical and radiological response to 4 weeks therapy with albendazole is quite satisfactory. All cases of young and adult onset epilepsy in tropical countries should be investigated for neurocysticercosis.","Albendazole; colloidal stage; neurocysticercosis; seizures","albendazole; anticonvulsive agent; corticosteroid; adolescent; adult; article; clinical article; clinical feature; computer assisted tomography; epilepsy; female; human; male; medical history; neurocysticercosis; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; parietal lobe; physical examination; Taenia solium; treatment outcome","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-79952944368"

The guidelines are intended for infectious disease specialists, neurologists, neurological surgeons, internists, pediatricians, and family practitioners. These guidelines present our approaches to the diagnosis and management of patients with the different forms of NCC, including viable parenchymal NCC (VPN), single enhancing lesions (SEL), calcified parenchymal NCC (CPN), ventricular NCC (IVN), and subarachnoid NCC (SAN). Our recommendations are based on the best evidence available. Because of the complex variations in clinical manifestations and the limitations of the literature, many of the recommendations are based on observational studies, anecdotal data, or expert opinion rather than randomized clinical trials. The approaches we describe are intended to be both applicable and feasible in the United States and Canada (for simplicity, referred to here as North America). The recommendations may not apply for settings where resource constraints may limit their applicability. The executive summary in the following paragraphs lists the recommendations for the diagnosis and clinical management of NCC. A detailed description of the methods, background, and evidence summaries that support each of the recommendations can be found online in the full text of the guidelines. A criterion for grading evidence is presented in Figure 1.1 Note that diagnosis and management of patients with NCC can be challenging even with expert guidelines. Because of this complexity, clinicians with little experience with this disease should have a low threshold for consultation with an expert in the disease. © 2018 by The American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene.","","American Medical Association; Communicable Diseases; Humans; Hygiene; Neurocysticercosis; Tropical Medicine; United States; albendazole; anticonvulsive agent; carbamazepine; clobazam; corticosteroid; dexamethasone; phenytoin; placebo; praziquantel; Article; brain ventricle peritoneum shunt; Canada; computer assisted tomography; general practitioner; human; internist; medical assessment; neurocysticercosis; neurologist; neurosurgeon; neurosurgery; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pediatrician; practice guideline; seizure; surgical approach; United States; communicable disease; hygiene; medical society; neurocysticercosis; tropical medicine","IDSA","Financial support: Support for these guidelines was provided by the IDSA and the ASTMH.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85045469311"

The emphasis will be on common infections causing stroke, including pyogenic meningitis, infective endocarditis, tuberculosis, leptospirosis, syphilis, as well as fungal and parasitic diseases. Most of these conditions cause stroke through a mechanism of angiitis, which is an inflammation of the vessel wall induced by the presence of microorganisms within the CNS. A stroke may occur as the primary or sole manifestation of the infectious disease or may present in the setting of a diffuse encephalopathy. Infection-related strokes may be ischemic or hemorrhagic and range in severity from asymptomatic to fatal.

Patients with new-onset seizures and MRI-confirmed SCCL were randomized to treatment with albendazole and antiepileptics (""treatment group"") or antiepileptics only (""controls""). Serial MRI including T2 relaxometry was performed at baseline, three, six, 12, and 24 months. Of 123 patients recruited, 81 had more than three MRI scans (treatment group: 37; controls: 44; 58 patients had five scans). The lesion wall at baseline showed a mean T2R value of 152.3 ms, centre 474.9 and perilesional parenchyma 338.5 ms. These were significantly higher than those from normal parenchyma (114 ms). Over time, most sharply in the initial three months, T2R values fell but even at 24 months, they remained above those from normal parenchyma. A slight increase in T2R values from the lesion centre at six months was thought to represent the initiation of gliosis. In the treatment group, T2R values approached normal at 24 months, while controls had persistently higher T2R values. The decline in T2R values at six months was more prominent in the treatment group. T2R values at baseline and at three months differed significantly depending on the stage of the lesion, being higher in stage 2 SCCL. T2R values from SCCL declined over 24 months, being significantly higher in earlier stages of degeneration. A mild increase after six months may be due to the initiation of gliosis. T2R values appear to decline faster in patients who receive albendazole.","Albendazole; Cysticercosis; Magnetic resonance imaging; Perilesional gliosis; T2 relaxometry","Albendazole; Algorithms; Anthelmintics; Anticonvulsants; Drug Therapy, Combination; Epilepsy; Female; Humans; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Neurocysticercosis; Prospective Studies; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity; Treatment Outcome; Young Adult; albendazole; cysticercosis; magnetic resonance imaging; perilesional gliosis; T2 relaxometry; albendazole; carbamazepine; gadolinium; oxcarbazepine; phenytoin; adolescent; adult; article; clinical evaluation; controlled study; degeneration; drug dose reduction; drug withdrawal; female; follow up; gliosis; gray matter; human; major clinical study; male; measurement; neurocysticercosis; neuroimaging; neurologic examination; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; nuclear magnetic resonance scanner; parenchyma; prospective study; quantitative serial t2 relaxometry; randomized controlled trial; seizure; solitary cerebral cysticercosis; white matter; young adult","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84904812809"

Methods: 178 patients with new onset symptoms due to active or transitional neurocysticercosis were randomly assigned to receive either 800 mg of ALB daily or placebo for 8 days. All patients also received prednisone. Imaging studies were done at baseline and at months 1, B and 12 of follow-up. Results: Active cysts were identified in 59 of 88 people randomised to ALB and 57 of the 90 in the placebo arm. By 1 month, 31% were free of active cysts in the treatment group compared with 7% in the placebo group (p = 0.001). In addition, the ALB group had a greater reduction in the number of active cysts compared with the placebo group (p = 0.001). After 1 month following treatment there was no additional gain by treatment group in the disappearance or reduction in the number of active cysts. ALB treatment had little effect on cysts in the transitional or calcification stage. We found no difference between the ALB and placebo groups in symptoms during treatment or in seizure recurrence during the 12 months after treatment. Conclusion: Albendazole plus symptomatic treatment leads to the disappearance of active cysts in 31% of patients compared with 7% of those with symptomatic treatment alone. This treatment effect occurs within the first 30 days after treatment.

Whether therapy with antiparasitic agents results in improved seizure control has been questioned because of the lack of adequate, controlled studies. METHODS: We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in which 120 patients who had living cysticerci in the brain and seizures treated with antiepileptic drugs were randomly assigned to receive either 800 mg of albendazole per day and 6 mg of dexamethasone per day for 10 days (60 patients) or two placebos (60 patients). The patients were followed for 30 months or until they had been seizure-free for 6 months after the doses of the antiepileptic drugs had been tapered. The efficacy of treatment was measured as the decrease in the number of seizures after treatment. RESULTS: In the albendazole group, there was a 46 percent reduction in the number of seizures (95 percent confidence interval, -74 to 83 percent) during months 2 to 30 after treatment. This reduction, which was not statistically significant, was composed of a non-significant reduction of 41 percent in the number of partial seizures (95 percent confidence interval, -124 to 84 percent) and a significant 67 percent reduction in the number of seizures with generalization (95 percent confidence interval, 20 to 86 percent). Most of the difference in the number of partial seizures was attributable to a few patients who had many seizures during follow-up. The proportions of patients who had partial seizures during follow-up were similar in the two groups (19 of 57 in the albendazole group and 16 of 59 in the placebo group), but the patients in the placebo group had a greater tendency to have seizures with generalization (22 of 59, vs. 13 of 57 in the albendazole group; risk ratio, 1.63; 95 percent confidence interval, 0. 91 to 2.92). More of the intracranial cystic lesions resolved in the albendazole group than in the placebo group. With the sole exception of abdominal pain, side effects did not differ significantly between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with seizures due to viable parenchymal cysts, antiparasitic therapy decreases the burden of parasites and is safe and effective, at least in reducing the number of seizures with generalization.","","Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Albendazole; Anti-Inflammatory Agents; Anticestodal Agents; Anticonvulsants; Brain; Brain Diseases; Dexamethasone; Double-Blind Method; Drug Therapy, Combination; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Granuloma; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Neurocysticercosis; Seizures; albendazole; anticonvulsive agent; antiparasitic agent; dexamethasone; abdominal pain; adolescent; adult; aged; article; clinical trial; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; developing country; diarrhea; dizziness; double blind procedure; drug efficacy; female; focal epilepsy; follow up; grand mal seizure; headache; human; liver toxicity; major clinical study; male; nausea; neurocysticercosis; neurologic disease; paresis; paresthesia; priority journal; randomized controlled trial; rash; risk assessment; seizure; side effect; treatment outcome","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-0346093858"

The model is motivated by a study of the neurocysticercosis (NC) cyst evolution at the cyst-level, taking into account the multiple cysts phases with intermittent missing data and loss to follow-up, as well as the intra-brain clustering of observations made on a predefined data collection schedule. Of particular interest in this study is the description of the process leading to cyst resolution, and whether this process varies by antiparasitic treatment. The model uses shared random effects to account for within-brain correlation and to explain the hidden heterogeneity governing the missing data mechanism. We developed a likelihood-based method using a Monte Carlo EM algorithm for the inference. The practical utility of the methods is illustrated using data from a randomized controlled trial on the effect of antiparasitic treatment with albendazole on NC cysts among patients from six hospitals in Ecuador. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed methods perform well in the finite sample and misspecified models that ignore the data complexities could lead to substantial biases. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","frailty survival model; interval-censoring; multistate joint model; neurocysticercosis; nonignorable missingness","albendazole; antiparasitic agent; algorithm; Article; data analysis; data clustering; data system; Ecuador; human; interval censored event history data; Markov chain; mathematical model; medical research; Monte Carlo method; neurocysticercosis; process model; treatment planning","City and State of New York; National Science Foundation, NSF, (ACI‐1126113, CNS‐0855217, CNS‐0958379); National Science Foundation, NSF; National Institutes of Health, NIH, (R01‐NS39403); National Institutes of Health, NIH; National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, NINDS; City University of New York, CUNY, (PSC‐CUNY ENHC 47); City University of New York, CUNY","This original RCT was supported by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke at the National Institutes of Health (R01‐NS39403).
