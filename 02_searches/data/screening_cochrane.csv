Patients with new‐onset seizures and MRI‐confirmed SCCL were randomized to treatment with albendazole and antiepileptics (""treatment group"") or antiepileptics only (""controls""). Serial MRI including T2 relaxometry was performed at baseline, three, six, 12, and 24 months. Of 123 patients recruited, 81 had more than three MRI scans (treatment group: 37; controls: 44; 58 patients had five scans). The lesion wall at baseline showed a mean T2R value of 152.3 ms, centre 474.9 and perilesional parenchyma 338.5 ms. These were significantly higher than those from normal parenchyma (114 ms). Over time, most sharply in the initial three months, T2R values fell but even at 24 months, they remained above those from normal parenchyma. A slight increase in T2R values from the lesion centre at six months was thought to represent the initiation of gliosis. In the treatment group, T2R values approached normal at 24 months, while controls had persistently higher T2R values. The decline in T2R values at six months was more prominent in the treatment group. T2R values at baseline and at three months differed significantly depending on the stage of the lesion, being higher in stage 2 SCCL. T2R values from SCCL declined over 24 months, being significantly higher in earlier stages of degeneration. A mild increase after six months may be due to the initiation of gliosis. T2R values appear to decline faster in patients who receive albendazole.","27","3","339‐349","Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)","PUBMED 24976202","EMBASE 373617581",,,,"Journal article","*measurement; *neurocysticercosis/di [Diagnosis]; *neurocysticercosis/dt [Drug Therapy]; *neurologic examination; *nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; *quantitative serial t2 relaxometry; *solitary cerebral cysticercosis/di [Diagnosis]; *solitary cerebral cysticercosis/dt [Drug Therapy]; Adolescent; Adult; Albendazole [*administration & dosage]; Albendazole/ct [Clinical Trial]; Albendazole/dt [Drug Therapy]; Algorithms; Anthelmintics [administration & dosage]; Anticonvulsants [*administration & dosage]; Article; Carbamazepine/dt [Drug Therapy]; Clinical evaluation; Controlled study; Degeneration; Drug Therapy, Combination; Drug dose reduction; Drug withdrawal; Epilepsy [*drug therapy, *pathology]; Female; Follow up; Gadolinium; Gliosis; Gray matter; Human; Humans; Image Interpretation, Computer‐Assisted [methods]; Magnetic Resonance Imaging [*methods]; Major clinical study; Male; Neurocysticercosis [*drug therapy, *pathology]; Neuroimaging; Nuclear magnetic resonance scanner; Oxcarbazepine/dt [Drug Therapy]; Parenchyma; Phenytoin/dt [Drug Therapy]; Prospective Studies; Prospective study; Randomized controlled trial; Reproducibility of Results; Seizure; Sensitivity and Specificity; Treatment Outcome; White matter; Young Adult; Young adult","10.15274/NRJ-2014-10054","https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-00998760/full","Epilepsy"

The role of antiparasitic (albendazole) therapy for seizure control and resolution of lesions is still controversial due to a lack of adequately controlled studies. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the role of albendazole therapy for neurocysticercosis patients with two or more lesions to achieve seizure‐free status and resolution of lesions. This was a randomised controlled study in which patients suffering from neurocysticercosis were prospectively followed up for more than 5 years (from January 1997 to January 2005). Patients were divided into two groups: patients in group A (n=150) were treated with a combination of tapered doses of dexamethasone and albendazole, plus antiepileptic drugs; patients in group B (n=150) were treated with antiepileptic drugs plus a placebo control. Patients were followed up every month for the first 6 months and then at 3‐month intervals thereafter up to 5 years. Variables of interest were (i) recurrence of seizures; (ii) encephalopathy (headache/vomiting/altered sensorium); (iii) need for subsequent hospital admission; (iv) death; (v) resolution of lesions on follow‐up CT. During the first 6 months and at intervals thereafter, increased seizure frequency and hospital readmissions, and increased incidence of encephalopathy were observed in group A (p=0.01), and two patients in this group died with intractable seizures and encephalopathy. A greater proportion of lesions completely resolved in group B (p=0.05), whereas a greater proportion of lesions calcified in group A (p=0.05). Albendazole plus antiepileptic drugs did not have greater beneficial effects than antiepileptic drugs alone, but may have an adverse effect with respect to seizure control, encephalopathy, recurrent hospital admissions, calcification of lesions and cost of treatment.","14","12","1172‐1177","Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)","PUBMED 17964789","EMBASE 350102785",,,,"Journal article","*neurocysticercosis/dt [Drug Therapy]; *seizure/dt [Drug Therapy]; Adult; Albendazole [*therapeutic use]; Albendazole/cb [Drug Combination]; Albendazole/do [Drug Dose]; Albendazole/dt [Drug Therapy]; Anthelmintics [*therapeutic use]; Anticonvulsive agent/cb [Drug Combination]; Anticonvulsive agent/dt [Drug Therapy]; Antiparasitic Agents [*therapeutic use]; Antiparasitic agent/dt [Drug Therapy]; Article; Brain [parasitology, pathology, physiopathology]; Brain damage; Brain disease; Carbamazepine/dt [Drug Therapy]; Clinical evaluation; Clinical trial; Computer assisted tomography; Controlled clinical trial; Controlled study; Dexamethasone/cb [Drug Combination]; Dexamethasone/do [Drug Dose]; Dexamethasone/po [Oral Drug Administration]; Drug dose reduction; Drug dose regimen; Electroencephalography; Enzyme‐Linked Immunosorbent Assay; Female; Follow up; Follow‐Up Studies; Headache; Hospital readmission; Hospitalization; Human; Humans; Major clinical study; Male; Neurocysticercosis [*complications, *drug therapy, pathology]; Neuroimaging; Nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; Phenytoin/dt [Drug Therapy]; Placebo; Priority journal; Randomized controlled trial; Seizures [*etiology]; Sensory system; Tomography, X‐Ray Computed; Tonic clonic seizure/dt [Drug Therapy]; Valproic acid/dt [Drug Therapy]; Vomiting","10.1016/j.jocn.2006.09.004","https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-00704417/full","Epilepsy; Infectious Diseases; Pain, Palliative and Supportive Care"

DESIGN: Randomised controlled prospective trial. METHODS AND MATERIAL: 123 patients with new‐onset seizures and SCCL on contrast MRI were randomised to treatment with albendazole and followed with up to five serial MRIs. RESULTS: 81 patients (M ‐ 41, F ‐ 40) with mean age of 19.6+/‐11.7years and 4 or 5 serial MRI were included in the analysis. Analysis was performed on 356 MRI's. Scolex was seen in 61.9% of patients in postcontrast T1 sequence in the first MRI study, and there was a significant drop in visibility from the next scan onwards. Cyst contents were initially T1‐hypointense and T2‐hyperintense with inversion on FLAIR in 30.8% and later scans showed T2‐hypointensity. Cyst wall characteristics changed significantly from initially T2‐hypointensity to later hyperintense rim. Initial scan revealed perilesional oedema in 98.5%, which is resolved by the second scan. Around 17.5% showed subtle perilesional T2‐hyperintensity in follow‐up scans. Enhancement pattern changed significantly from ring to disc, and later to non‐enhancement. Initially, 69.7% lesions were in colloid‐vesicular stage. Lesions moved through subsequent stages of cyst degeneration: time needed for this process is described. Imaging characteristics, both on the first and on subsequent scans, did not differ between albendazole and control groups. CONCLUSIONS: Evolution of SCCL follows a predictable sequence corresponding to morphologic stages described earlier, taking over a year to complete. Contrast enhancement decreases as degeneration progresses, but some calcific lesions continue to enhance. Albendazole therapy may hasten resolution of inflammation around the lesion but affects neither the morphology of the cysticercus nor the process of degeneration and subsequent healing.","288","1‐2","135‐141","Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)","PUBMED 19875133",,,,,"Journal article","Adolescent; Adult; Albendazole [*therapeutic use]; Anthelmintics [*therapeutic use]; Brain [parasitology, pathology]; Child; Cohort Studies; Contrast Media; Disease Progression; Female; Gadolinium; Humans; Image Processing, Computer‐Assisted; India; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Neurocysticercosis [*drug therapy, parasitology, *pathology]; Prospective Studies; Tomography, X‐Ray Computed; Treatment Outcome; Young Adult","10.1016/j.jns.2009.09.018","https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-00730991/full",

METHODS: Patients with new‐onset seizures due to SCC were imaged serially using a pre‐determined MRI protocol at enrolment and after 3, 6, 12 and 24months. T2 relaxometry was performed using a dual echo sequence with maps generated manually from the measured image intensities at the level of the lesion. Patients were randomised to receive albendazole plus antiepileptic drugs, or only antiepileptic treatment (""controls""). At each visit, as well as four years after study initiation, patients were reviewed for seizure recurrence. Clinical and radiological outcomes were assessed by physicians blinded to treatment received. RESULTS: Of 123 patients recruited, 77 had at least four MRIs and >12month follow‐up, and were included for analysis. Baseline clinical and demographic parameters as well as antiepileptic treatment were similar between albendazole and control groups. T2 values from the lesion were higher than normal parenchyma initially, and fell to approach normal over six months. Controls had higher T2 values from the lesion centre and wall at six months than those who received albendazole. However no difference was seen in T2 values from perilesional parenchyma between treatment and control groups, indicating lack of modulation of the development of perilesional gliosis by albendazole therapy. Patients with seizures persisting >6months after enrolment had higher perilesional T2 values than those who were seizure‐free. A rise in perilesional T2 value at 12months is probably due to gliosis. A later stage of degeneration was associated with a reduced likelihood of seizure relapse. SIGNIFICANCE: T2 relaxometry at three and six months after seizure onset can identify patients likely to have seizures beyond six months after onset. Persistently abnormal T2 values in patients with poorer outcomes reflect the development of perilesional gliosis.","376",,"1‐6","Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)","PUBMED 28431589","EMBASE 614635624",,,,"Journal article","*gliosis; *measurement; *neurocysticercosis; *neurocysticercosis/dt [Drug Therapy]; *relaxation time; *seizure; *seizure/dt [Drug Therapy]; *t2 relaxometry; Adolescent; Adult; Albendazole; Albendazole [therapeutic use]; Albendazole/cb [Drug Combination]; Albendazole/cm [Drug Comparison]; Albendazole/dt [Drug Therapy]; Anticonvulsant therapy; Anticonvulsants [therapeutic use]; Anticonvulsive agent; Article; Brain [*diagnostic imaging, *drug effects]; Carbamazepine/cb [Drug Combination]; Carbamazepine/dt [Drug Therapy]; Child; Child, Preschool; Chronic Disease; Clinical outcome; Clinical trial; Control group; Controlled clinical trial; Controlled study; Demography; Drug Therapy, Combination; Drug therapy; Female; Follow up; Follow‐Up Studies; Gliosis [diagnostic imaging, drug therapy]; Human; Humans; Image intensification; Magnetic Resonance Imaging [methods]; Major clinical study; Male; Middle Aged; Modulation; Neurocysticercosis [*complications, diagnostic imaging]; Neurocysticercosis/dt [Drug Therapy]; Nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; Nuclear magnetic resonance scanner; Oxcarbazepine/cb [Drug Combination]; Oxcarbazepine/dt [Drug Therapy]; Parenchyma; Phenytoin/cb [Drug Combination]; Phenytoin/dt [Drug Therapy]; Physician; Praziquantel/cb [Drug Combination]; Praziquantel/cm [Drug Comparison]; Praziquantel/dt [Drug Therapy]; Priority journal; Prognosis; Prognostic assessment; Prospective study; Randomized controlled trial; Recurrent disease; Relapse; Seizure/dt [Drug Therapy]; Seizures [*diagnostic imaging, *drug therapy, etiology]; Single blind procedure; Time Factors; Treatment Outcome; Treatment duration; Young Adult","10.1016/j.jns.2017.02.052","https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-01339612/full",

Whether therapy with antiparasitic agents results in improved seizure control has been questioned because of the lack of adequate, controlled studies. METHODS: We conducted a double‐blind, placebo‐controlled trial in which 120 patients who had living cysticerci in the brain and seizures treated with antiepileptic drugs were randomly assigned to receive either 800 mg of albendazole per day and 6 mg of dexamethasone per day for 10 days (60 patients) or two placebos (60 patients). The patients were followed for 30 months or until they had been seizure‐free for 6 months after the doses of the antiepileptic drugs had been tapered. The efficacy of treatment was measured as the decrease in the number of seizures after treatment. RESULTS: In the albendazole group, there was a 46 percent reduction in the number of seizures (95 percent confidence interval, ‐74 to 83 percent) during months 2 to 30 after treatment. This reduction, which was not statistically significant, was composed of a nonsignificant reduction of 41 percent in the number of partial seizures (95 percent confidence interval, ‐124 to 84 percent) and a significant 67 percent reduction in the number of seizures with generalization (95 percent confidence interval, 20 to 86 percent). Most of the difference in the number of partial seizures was attributable to a few patients who had many seizures during follow‐up. The proportions of patients who had partial seizures during follow‐up were similar in the two groups (19 of 57 in the albendazole group and 16 of 59 in the placebo group), but the patients in the placebo group had a greater tendency to have seizures with generalization (22 of 59, vs. 13 of 57 in the albendazole group; risk ratio, 1.63; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.91 to 2.92). More of the intracranial cystic lesions resolved in the albendazole group than in the placebo group. With the sole exception of abdominal pain, side effects did not differ significantly between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with seizures due to viable parenchymal cysts, antiparasitic therapy decreases the burden of parasites and is safe and effective, at least in reducing the number of seizures with generalization.","350","3","249‐258","Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)","PUBMED 14724304",,,,,"Journal article","Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Albendazole [adverse effects, *therapeutic use]; Anticestodal Agents [adverse effects, *therapeutic use]; Anticonvulsants [therapeutic use]; Anti‐Inflammatory Agents [therapeutic use]; Brain Diseases [complications, *drug therapy, pathology]; Brain [pathology]; Dexamethasone [therapeutic use]; Double‐Blind Method; Drug Therapy, Combination; Female; Follow‐Up Studies; Granuloma [etiology]; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Neurocysticercosis [complications, *drug therapy, pathology]; Seizures [*drug therapy, etiology]","10.1056/NEJMoa031294","https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-00460049/full","Epilepsy; Infectious Diseases"

Background and Study Rationale: between the forms of human cysticercosis caused by Taenia solium, neurocysticercosis is a major contributor to the burden of seizure disorders and epilepsy in most of the world, while it has relatively poor clinical evidence on treatment options, requiring further data, mainly from additional randomized controlled trials. In particular albendazole and praziquantel are the two parasiticides recommended for use in treating active neurocysticercosis (NCC). Specifically, albendazole is recommended for use in patients with a single cyst while both albendazole and praziquantel (combination therapy) are recommended for patients with multiple cysts. However, not all patients with single cysts respond to albendazole monotherapy. Combination therapy may be effective in patients with single cysts as it has already been shown effective for multiple cysts. Most studies of treatment success for NCC have been conducted in Latin America and India. In India, the studies were performed primarily on singular cystic lesions. Despite Sub‐Saharan Africa (SSA) being recognized as endemic for this parasite, no study evaluating the success of standard treatment in humans has been conducted in this region. Additionally, it is difficult to extrapolate information from other regions other than SSA due to possible differences in genetic, clinical, and environmental factors. Primary Objective: The primary objective of this study is to determine if the anthelmintics combination of praziquantel and albendazole is better than albendazole alone in the treatment of the active parenchymal neurocysticercosis based on cyst resolution. Secondary Objectives: 1. To determine if the combination of antiparasitic praziquantel and albendazole is better than albendazole alone in the treatment of active parenchymal neurocysticercosis based on seizures reduction 2.

Antiparasitic treatment of viable brain cysts is of clinical benefit, but current antiparasitic regimes provide incomplete parasiticidal efficacy. Combined use of two antiparasitic drugs may improve clearance of brain parasites. Albendazole (ABZ) has been used together with praziquantel (PZQ) before for geohelminths, echinococcosis and cysticercosis, but their combined use is not yet formally recommended and only scarce, discrepant data exist on their pharmacokinetics when given together. We assessed the pharmacokinetics of their combined use for the treatment of neurocysticercosis. METHODS: A randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled phase II evaluation of the pharmacokinetics of ABZ and PZQ in 32 patients with neurocysticercosis was carried out. Patients received their usual concomitant medications including an antiepileptic drug, dexamethasone, and ranitidine. Randomization was stratified by antiepileptic drug (phenytoin or carbamazepine). Subjects had sequential blood samples taken after the first dose of antiparasitic drugs and again after 9 days of treatment, and were followed for 3 months after dosing. RESULTS: Twenty‐one men and 11 women, aged 16 to 55 (mean age 28) years were included. Albendazole sulfoxide concentrations were increased in the combination group compared with the ABZ alone group, both in patients taking phenytoin and patients taking carbamazepine. PZQ concentrations were also increased by the end of therapy. There were no significant side effects in this study group. CONCLUSIONS: Combined ABZ + PZQ is associated with increased albendazole sulfoxide plasma concentrations. These increased concentrations could independently contribute to increased cysticidal efficacy by themselves or in addition to a possible synergistic effect.","72","1","77‐84","Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)","PUBMED 21332573",,,,,"Journal article","Adolescent; Adult; Albendazole [*pharmacokinetics, therapeutic use]; Animals; Anthelmintics [*pharmacokinetics, therapeutic use]; Drug Therapy, Combination; Female; Humans; Male; Neurocysticercosis [drug therapy, *metabolism, parasitology]; Peru; Praziquantel [*pharmacokinetics, therapeutic use]; Taenia solium [isolation & purification]; Young Adult","10.1111/j.1365-2125.2011.03945.x","https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-00812573/full","Infectious Diseases"

PURPOSE: To perform a meta‐analysis of randomized trials assessing the effect of cysticidal drugs on neuroimaging and clinical outcomes of patients with neurocysticercosis. DATA SOURCES: Search of MEDLINE, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Literatura Latino‐Americana y del Caribe en Ciencias de la Salud (LILACS) between 1979 and 2005. There were no language restrictions. STUDY SELECTION: Randomized trials of cysticidal drug therapy for neurocysticercosis that met predefined criteria designed to allow characterization of the disease and objective evaluation of therapy. The authors independently reviewed articles. Abstracted data included study design, number of randomly assigned patients and withdrawals, intervention, adverse events, timing of neuroimaging studies, and outcomes. DATA SYNTHESIS: Eleven studies met the inclusion criteria. Six trials randomly assigned 464 patients with cystic lesions (vesicular cysticerci), and 5 trials randomly assigned 478 patients with enhancing lesions (colloidal cysticerci). Parasites were located in the brain parenchyma or subarachnoid space at the convexity of the cerebral hemispheres. Cysticidal drug therapy was associated with complete resolution of cystic lesions (44% vs. 19%; P = 0.025). Trials on enhancing lesions showed a trend toward lesion resolution favoring the use of cysticidal drugs (72% vs. 63%; P = 0.38) that became statistically significant when an outlier trial was excluded from the analysis (69% vs. 55%; P = 0.006). Risk for seizure recurrence was lower after cysticidal treatment in patients with enhancing lesions (14% vs. 37%; P < 0.001). The single trial evaluating the frequency of seizures in patients with cystic lesions showed a 67% reduction in the rate of generalized seizures with treatment (P = 0.006). LIMITATIONS: Not all studies focused on the control of seizures as an outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Cysticidal drug therapy results in better resolution of colloidal and vesicular cysticerci, lower risk for recurrence of seizures in patients with colloidal cysticerci, and a reduction in the rate of generalized seizures in patients with vesicular cysticerci.","145","1","43‐51","Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)","PUBMED 16818928","EMBASE 46780606",,,,"Journal article","*neurocysticercosis /drug therapy; Adolescent; Adult; Albendazole [adverse effects, *therapeutic use]; Anthelmintics [adverse effects, *therapeutic use]; Brain region; Child; Clinical trial; Cochrane Library; Controlled clinical trial; Controlled study; Double blind procedure; Drug efficacy; Female; Human; Humans; Major clinical study; Male; Medical record review; Medline; Meta analysis; Neurocysticercosis [complications, diagnostic imaging, *drug therapy]; Praziquantel [adverse effects, *therapeutic use]; Priority journal; Radiography; Randomized controlled trial; Review; Secondary Prevention; Seizures [etiology, prevention & control]; Subarachnoid Space [parasitology]; Subarachnoid space; Systematic review; Treatment duration; Treatment outcome","10.7326/0003-4819-145-1-200607040-00009","https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-01775791/full",

Infectious diseases","2014","BACKGROUND: Neurocysticercosis causes a substantial burden of seizure disorders worldwide. Treatment with either praziquantel or albendazole has suboptimum efficacy. We aimed to establish whether combination of these drugs would increase cysticidal efficacy and whether complete cyst resolution results in fewer seizures. We added an increased dose albendazole group to establish a potential effect of increased albendazole concentrations. METHODS: In this double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, phase 3 trial, patients with viable intraparenchymal neurocysticercosis were randomly assigned to receive 10 days of combined albendazole (15 mg/kg per day) plus praziquantel (50 mg/kg per day), standard albendazole (15 mg/kg per day), or increased dose albendazole (22·5 mg/kg per day). Randomisation was done with a computer generated schedule balanced within four strata based on number of cysts and concomitant antiepileptic drug. Patients and investigators were masked to group assignment. The primary outcome was complete cyst resolution on 6‐month MRI. Enrolment was stopped after interim analysis because of parasiticidal superiority of one treatment group. Analysis excluded patients lost to follow‐up before the 6‐month MRI. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00441285. FINDINGS: Between March 3, 2010 and Nov 14, 2011, 124 patients were randomly assigned to study groups (41 to receive combined albendazole plus praziquantel [39 analysed], 43 standard albendazole [41 analysed], and 40 increased albendazole [38 analysed]). 25 (64%) of 39 patients in the combined treatment group had complete resolution of brain cysts compared with 15 (37%) of 41 patients in the standard albendazole group (rate ratio [RR] 1·75, 95% CI 1·10‐2·79, p=0·014). 20 (53%) of 38 patients in the increased albendazole group had complete cyst resolution at 6‐month MRI compared with 15 (37%) of 41 patients in the standard albendazole group (RR 1·44, 95% CI 0·87‐2·38, p=0·151). No significant differences in adverse events were reported between treatment groups (18 in combined treatment group, 11 in standard albendazole group, and 19 in increased albendazole group). INTERPRETATION: Combination of albendazole plus praziquantel increases the parasiticidal effect in patients with multiple brain cysticercosis cysts without increased side‐effects. A more efficacious parasiticidal regime without increased treatment‐associated side‐effects should improve the treatment and long term prognosis of patients with neurocysticercosis.

At baseline, the majority of lesions were ring‐enhancing (70%), colloidal (97%), with scolex (68%) and perilesional‐edema (45%), and located in the parietal (58%) lobe. One case each in albendazole and placebo groups had a recurrence of seizure in the first month of treatment. The majority (62%) of children in the combination therapy group showed complete resolution of the persisting lesion at the end of 6 months compared to the albendazole alone group (26.3%, P =.02). Percentage reduction in the lesion's mean area at 6 months was highest in the combination group compared with other groups (P =.006). Rate of calcification was identical in all 3 groups (10%). None of the patients required interruption of therapy. Conclusion: Our study demonstrates the safety and efficacy of albendazole and praziquantel in combination for complete radiologic resolution in children with persistent neurocysticercosis when compared with albendazole monotherapy or placebo. The combination therapy did not result in increased seizure recurrence or adverse drug reaction compared with albendazole monotherapy.","37","5","366‐372","Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)","PUBMED 35213246","EMBASE 2015143747",,,,"Journal article","*monotherapy; *neurocysticercosis; Adolescent; Adverse drug reaction; Albendazole [adverse effects, therapeutic use]; Anthelmintics [adverse effects, therapeutic use]; Article; Calcification; Child; Child, Preschool; Clinical article; Clinical trial; Comparative effectiveness; Controlled study; Double blind procedure; Drug Therapy, Combination; Drug combination; Drug efficacy; Drug safety; Drug therapy; Edema; Female; Human; Humans; Male; Neurocysticercosis [complications, diagnostic imaging, drug therapy]; Nonhuman; Praziquantel [adverse effects, therapeutic use]; Randomized controlled trial; School child; Scolex; Seizure; Seizures [drug therapy, etiology]; Side effect","10.1177/08830738221077762","https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-02376164/full",

Larval cysts in the human brain eventually resolve and either disappear or leave a calcification that is associated with seizures. In this study, we assessed the proportion of calcification in parenchymal neurocysticercosis and risk factors associated with calcification. METHODS: Data for 220 patients with parenchymal NCC from 3 trials of antiparasitic treatment were assessed to determine what proportion of the cysts that resolved 6 months after treatment ended up in a residual calcification at 1 year. Also, we evaluated the risk factors associated with calcification. RESULTS: The overall proportion of calcification was 38% (188/497 cysts, from 147 patients). Predictors for calcification at the cyst level were cysts larger than 14 mm (risk ratio [RR], 1.34; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02‐1.75) and cysts with edema at baseline (RR, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.05‐1.85). At the patient level, having had more than 24 months with seizures (RR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.08‐1.46), mild antibody response (RR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.002‐1.27), increased dose albendazole regime (RR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.14‐1.39), lower doses of dexamethasone (RR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.02‐1.81), not receiving early antiparasitic retreatment (RR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.08‐1.93), or complete cure (RR, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.29‐1.71) were associated with a increased risk of calcification. CONCLUSIONS: Approximately 38% of parenchymal cysts calcify after antiparasitic treatment. Some factors associated with calcification are modifiable and may be considered to decrease or avoid calcification, potentially decreasing the risk for seizure relapses.","73","9","e2592‐e2600","Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)","PUBMED 32556276","EMBASE 632128287",,,,"Journal article","*Neurocysticercosis [complications, drug therapy, epidemiology]; *Taenia solium; *calcification; *neurocysticercosis; *risk factor; Adult; Albendazole [therapeutic use]; Animals; Antibody response; Antiparasitic Agents [therapeutic use]; Antiparasitic therapy; Article; Brain; Controlled study; Cyst; Edema; Female; Human; Humans; Low drug dose; Major clinical study; Male; Nonhuman; Randomized controlled trial; Retreatment; Risk assessment; Seizure; Seizures [epidemiology, etiology]","10.1093/cid/ciaa784","https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-02139360/full",

METHODS: We used data from a randomized controlled trial comparing albendazole with placebo among patients newly diagnosed with NC. Based on our causal model, we explored the associations among albendazole treatment, NC cyst evolution, and seizure outcomes over 24 months of follow‐up using generalized linear mixed effect models. RESULTS: We included 153 participants, of whom 51% received albendazole. The association between seizure outcomes and treatment over time demonstrated lack of linearity and heterogeneity, requiring the inclusion of time‐treatment interaction terms for valid modeling. Participants in the albendazole group had fewer seizures overall and of partial onset at all time points compared with the placebo group, but the difference increased over the first few months following treatment, then decreased over time. Generalized seizures exhibited a more complex association; those in the albendazole group had fewer seizures compared with those in the placebo group for the first few months after treatment, and then the association reversed and those in the placebo arm had fewer seizures. Adjusting for the number of NC cysts in each phase resulted in an attenuation of the strength of association between albendazole and seizure outcomes, consistent with mediation. Among participants in whom all cysts had disappeared (n = 21), none continued to have seizures. SIGNIFICANCE: Albendazole treatment is associated with a possible reduction in focal seizures in the short term (3‐6 months), perhaps by hastening the resolution of the cysts. However, the effect is not discernible over the long term, because most cysts either calcify or resolve completely, regardless of whether treated with albendazole. The stage of evolution of the cysticercus is an important consideration in the evaluation of albendazole effect on seizure outcome.","60","9","1820‐1828","Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)","PUBMED 31355931","EMBASE 628848386",,,,"Journal article","*cyst; *focal epilepsy; *neurocysticercosis; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Albendazole [*therapeutic use]; Anthelmintics [*therapeutic use]; Article; Attenuation; Child; Child, Preschool; Controlled study; Disease Progression; Disease simulation; Drug therapy; Female; Follow up; Human; Humans; Major clinical study; Male; Middle Aged; Neurocysticercosis [complications, *drug therapy]; Randomized controlled trial; Seizures [*drug therapy, etiology]; Tonic clonic seizure; Treatment Outcome; Young Adult","10.1111/epi.16302","https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-01976129/full",

METHODS: We randomized 123 patients with SCC and new‐onset seizures to treatment with albendazole plus antiepileptics (treatment), or antiepileptics only (control), and performed magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans at 0, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months. Prospective follow‐up data regarding seizure outcome up to 5 years later were collected. MRI studies were analyzed for lesion characteristics and perilesional magnetization transfer (MT) hyperintensity. KEY FINDINGS: Clinical and radiologic data of 77 patients were analyzed. Demographic and seizure characteristics were similar in treatment and control groups. Clinical data were available up to 64 months after enrollment. At 12 months, 89.5% patients were seizure‐free. MTI is more sensitive than routine imaging for detection of perilesional gliosis. Albendazole treatment did not affect imaging or clinical outcome, including development of gliosis. Independent of duration of follow‐up, gliosis was associated with more seizures, and with seizure recurrence at 12 months; duration of seizures and antiepileptic therapy was longer. Gliosis was not dependent on seizure type or stage of degeneration at enrollment or persistence/calcification of the lesion. SIGNIFICANCE: Perilesional gliosis around SCC helps prognosticate seizure outcome. Poorer outcome in patients with persistent lesions is likely to be related to mechanisms other than gliosis. The lack of effect of albendazole on seizure outcome may be due to its inability to decrease formation of gliosis.","52","10","1918‐1927","Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)","PUBMED 21777233",,,,,"Journal article","Adolescent; Adult; Albendazole [administration & dosage, therapeutic use]; Anthelmintics [administration & dosage, therapeutic use]; Anticonvulsants [administration & dosage, therapeutic use]; Brain [parasitology, pathology]; Child; Child, Preschool; Drug Therapy, Combination; Gliosis [drug therapy, etiology, *parasitology, pathology]; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Neurocysticercosis [*complications, drug therapy, pathology]; Prospective Studies; Seizures [drug therapy, etiology, *parasitology, pathology]; Young Adult","10.1111/j.1528-1167.2011.03189.x","https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-00810577/full","Epilepsy"

A recent study demonstrated that combining these 2 antiparasitic drugs improves antiparasitic efficacy. We present here the parasiticidal efficacy data obtained during a previous phase II pharmacokinetic study that compared combined ABZ plus PZQ with ABZ alone. METHODS: The study was a randomized, double‐blinded, placebo‐controlled phase II evaluation of the pharmacokinetics of ABZ (15 mg/k/d, for 10 days) and PZQ (50 mg/k/d, for 10 days) in intraparenchymal brain cysticercosis. Patients received the usual concomitant medications, including an antiepileptic drug (phenytoin or carbamazepine), dexamethasone, and ranitidine. Randomization was stratified by antiepileptic drug. Patients underwent safety laboratory evaluations at days 4, 7, and 11, as well as magnetic resonance (MR) imaging at 6 months to assess parasiticidal efficacy. RESULTS: Thirty‐two patients were included, 16 in each arm. All of them completed antiparasitic treatment and underwent follow‐up brain MR imaging. Cysticidal efficacy was strikingly higher in the combined ABZ‐plus‐PZQ group than in the ABZ‐alone group (proportion of cysts resolved, 78 of 82 [95%] vs 23 of 77 [30%] [relative risk {RR}, 3.18; 95% confidence interval {CI}, 2.08‐4.88; P < .001]; patients with complete cyst clearance, 12 of 16 [75%] vs 4 of 16 [25%] [RR, 3.00; 95% CI, 1.23‐7.34; P = .005]).

METHODS: 178 patients with new onset symptoms due to active or transitional neurocysticercosis were randomly assigned to receive either 800 mg of ALB daily or placebo for 8 days. All patients also received prednisone. Imaging studies were done at baseline and at months 1, 6 and 12 of follow‐up. RESULTS: Active cysts were identified in 59 of 88 people randomised to ALB and 57 of the 90 in the placebo arm. By 1 month, 31% were free of active cysts in the treatment group compared with 7% in the placebo group (p = 0.001). In addition, the ALB group had a greater reduction in the number of active cysts compared with the placebo group (p = 0.001).

OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy of 14‐day and 28‐day albendazole therapy in the management of children with newly diagnosed active NCC. STUDY DESIGN: Open‐labelled randomized controlled trial. PARTICIPANTS: Children aged 1‐14 years with newly diagnosed active neurocysticercosis. INTERVENTION: Albendazole (15 mg/kg/day) for either 14 days or 28 days. OUTCOME: The primary outcome measure was proportion of children with radiological resolution of active lesion at 6‐month follow up.

RESULTS: 65 children with newly diagnosed NCC were rando‐mized to receive albendazole therapy for 14 days (n=32) or 28 days (n=33). The proportion of children with complete resolution was comparable between the two groups [6 (18.8%) vs. 9 (27.3%); OR (95%CI):0.61 (0.19 to 1.98); P=0.56]. Similarly, proportion of children with seizure recurrence [5(15.6%) vs 2(6.1%); OR (95%CI): 2.87(0.51‐16.0); P=0.26] and proportion of children with calcification on follow‐up imaging [26(81.2%) vs 23(69.7%); OR (95%CI): 1.88 (0.59‐5.99); P=0.39] were also comparable.

Solitary cysticercus granuloma, a benign form of parenchymal neurocysticercosis, is considered to be the most common aetiology for SSECTL. Definite information is lacking regarding the effectiveness of antiparasitic treatment on resolution of these lesions and on long term seizure recurrence. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the response to albendazole treatment in patients who had SSECTL and new onset seizures treated with antiepileptic drugs (AED) in a prospective clinical trial.

An estimated 50 million humans are affected by Neurocysticercosis. The disease occurs when a parasite called Taenia solium, or the pig tapeworm, infects the brain, forming cysts. Neurocysticercosis is generally treated with 1 of 2 drugs, praziquantel or albendazole. However, current treatment with either of these drugs alone is not totally effective. The goal of this trial is to determine if combination drug therapy of praziquantel and albendazole is safe and more effective to cure Neurocysticercosis than either drug administered alone. This trial will consist of two sub‐studies and a parent study. In the first substudy which was performed and completed as the initial part and guide to the design of the parent study, a series of 32 patients with viable cystic intraparenchymal Neurocysticercosis were treated with either albendazole ( 15 mg / kg /d ) + praziquantel ( 50 mg / kg/ d ) or albendazole+Placebo in a double blind randomized study. Half of patients in each group had their seizure disorder treated with phenytoin and the other half with carbamazepine (not assigned by the study). The study was designed and powered for pharmacokinetic evaluation and exploratory safety so comparative cysticidal efficacy has not yet been analyzed. There were no safety concerns. Pharmacokinetics of ABZ and PZQ were obtained and described. In the parent study, a total of 240 participants ( including the 32 participants from the first substudy ) will be randomly chosen to receive albendazole + praziquantel, albendazole + placebo or albendazole at an increased dose + placebo for 10 days. These groups will also receive other standard medications to manage the disease including appropriate anti‐epileptic drug therapy. Participants will stay in the hospital for at least 2 weeks after treatment begins, which includes 5 days after the end of anti‐parasitic treatment. After discharge from the hospital, follow‐up visits will be on days 21 and 30 after treatment begins, then monthly until day 90, and finally every 3 months until completing 18 months. Brain images will be taken at 6 and 12 months after treatment begins.

An optimal duration of albendazole therapy is not exactly known. Even 3‐day therapy has been found effective. METHODS: We included 105 patients of new‐onset seizures and solitary cysticercus granuloma. We compared 3‐day albendazole therapy and 15‐day therapy with a control group. Each group had 35 patients. This was an open‐label randomized trial. Patients were followed for 6 months. MRI was done after 6 months. Seizure recurrences during follow‐up were noted. RESULTS: After 6 months, albendazole group, in comparison to placebo group, had significantly higher proportion (43/70 versus 13/35) of patients in whom lesion had disappeared. Albendazole treatment for 15 days was insignificantly better in comparison to 3‐day treatment regimen. In 15‐day albendazole group lesser number of lesions (2.8%) was calcified than 3‐day albendazole group (8.57%) or no treatment group (20%). After 6 months of follow‐up, seizure recurrence was seen in 20 (19%) patients. The majority (15/20) of patients, experiencing seizure recurrence, had an abnormal follow‐up MRI. Five patients had seizures despite normal MRI. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, albendazole was significantly better in producing lesion resolution. A 15‐day treatment with albendazole was better than 3‐day treatment. Albendazole, possibly, led to less number of lesions got calcified and possibly, there was less risk of seizure recurrence.","316","1‐2","36‐41","Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)","PUBMED 22342396",,,,,"Journal article","Adolescent; Adult; Albendazole [*administration & dosage]; Animals; Anthelmintics [*administration & dosage]; Child; Child, Preschool; Cysticercus; Drug Administration Schedule; Female; Follow‐Up Studies; Granuloma [complications, diagnosis, *drug therapy]; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Neurocysticercosis [complications, diagnosis, *drug therapy]; Seizures [diagnosis, drug therapy, etiology]; Young Adult","10.1016/j.jns.2012.02.006","https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-00881150/full",

We investigated the role of albendazole and praziquantel in the treatment of patients with parenchymal neurocysticercosis by performing a meta‐analysis of comparative trials of their effectiveness and safety. METHODS AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We performed a search in the PubMed database, Cochrane Database of Controlled Trials, and in references of relevant articles. Six studies were included in the meta‐analysis. Albendazole was associated with better control of seizures than praziquantel in the pooled data analysis, when the generic inverse variance method was used to combine the incidence of seizure control in the included trials (patients without seizures/[patients x years at risk]) (156 patients in 4 studies, point effect estimate [incidence rate ratio] = 4.94, 95% confidence interval 2.45‐9.98). In addition, albendazole was associated with better effectiveness than praziquantel in the total disappearance of cysts (335 patients in 6 studies, random effects model, OR = 2.30, 95% CI 1.06‐5.00). There was no difference between albendazole and praziquantel in reduction of cysts, proportion of patients with adverse events, and development of intracranial hypertension due to the administered therapy. CONCLUSIONS: A critical review of the available data from comparative trials suggests that albendazole is more effective than praziquantel regarding clinically important outcomes in patients with neurocysticercosis. Nevertheless, given the relative scarcity of trials, more comparative interventional studies‐‐especially randomized controlled trials‐‐are required to draw a safe conclusion about the best regimen for the treatment of patients with parenchymal neurocysticercosis.","2","3","e194","Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)","PUBMED 18335068","EMBASE 352002945",,,,"Journal article","*neurocysticercosis /drug therapy /etiology; Albendazole [*therapeutic use]; Article; Clinical Trials as Topic; Clinical trial; Cochrane Library; Confidence interval; Controlled clinical trial; Data analysis; Drug efficacy; Drug safety; Human; Humans; Incidence; Information retrieval; Intracranial hypertension; Medline; Meta analysis; Neurocysticercosis [*drug therapy]; Outcome assessment; Praziquantel [*therapeutic use]; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Randomized controlled trial; Risk assessment; Seizure /drug therapy; Systematic review; Taenia solium; Treatment Outcome; Variance","10.1371/journal.pntd.0000194","https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-01723840/full",

Background: The impact of anthelmintic treatment on the probability of continued seizures and the development of epilepsy in NC patients is still debated. Design/Methods: We used data from a randomized controlled trial comparing albendazole with placebo among patients newly diagnosed with NC. Based on our causal model, we explored the associations among albendazole treatment, NC cyst evolution, and seizure outcomes over 24 months of follow‐up using generalized linear mixed effect models. Results: We included 153 participants (51% received albendazole). The association between seizure outcomes and treatment over time demonstrated lack of linearity and heterogeneity, requiring the inclusion of time‐treatment interaction terms for valid modeling. Participants in the albendazole group had fewer seizures overall and of partial onset at all time points compared with the placebo group, but the difference increased over the first few months following treatment, then decreased over time. Generalized seizures exhibited a more complex association; those in the albendazole group had fewer seizures compared with those in the placebo group for the first few months after treatment, and then the association reversed and those in the placebo arm had fewer seizures. Adjusting for the number of NC cysts in each phase resulted in an attenuation of the strength of association between albendazole and seizure outcomes, consistent with mediation. Among participants in whom all cysts had disappeared (n = 21), none continued to have seizures. Conclusions: Albendazole treatment is associated with a possible reduction in focal seizures in the short term by hastening the cysts resolution; however, the effect is not discernible over the long term, because most cysts either calcify or resolve completely, regardless of whether treated with albendazole. Once cysts fully resolved, seizures ceased, suggesting that seizures were acute symptomatic.","94","15",,"Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)",,"EMBASE 633068120",,,,"Journal article; Conference proceeding","*cyst; *focal epilepsy; *neurocysticercosis; Adult; Causal model; Clinical trial; Conference abstract; Controlled study; Disease simulation; Drug therapy; Female; Follow up; Human; Major clinical study; Male; Randomized controlled trial; Tonic clonic seizure",,"https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-02195124/full",

"CN-02026595","NCT00507221,","Empiric Therapy of Helminth Co-infection to Reduce HIV-1 Disease Progression","https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT00507221","2007","INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND: BACKGROUND, SIGNIFICANCE AND RATIONALE • Epidemiology of HIV‐1 and helminth infections in Africa: Over two thirds of all HIV‐1 infected individuals live in Africa. An expected 4 million new infections will occur this year in Africa alone. While antiretroviral therapies (ARTs) offer the hope of stemming this tremendous public health disaster, the reality is that many individuals are not able to access ARTs. In addition, millions of HIV infected individuals do not yet qualify for ART based on clinical or immunologic staging criteria. Alternative care strategies to delay immunosuppression and reduce infectivity are critically needed. Treatment of co‐infections that are prevalent in areas of high HIV‐1 sero‐prevalence may be one strategy to address this need. Helminths represent some of the most common infections of humans throughout the world. It is estimated that over half of all individuals living in Sub‐Saharan Africa are infected with at least on species of soil transmitted helminths. Distribution mapping of HIV‐1 sero‐prevalence and helminth infection prevalence reveal remarkably geographic similarities. We have recently conducted a large study of helminth infection among HIV‐1 infected adults at several sites in Kenya. While rates of helminth co‐infection are highest in Kilifi and Nyanza sites, there is a significant rate of co‐infection even within the greater Nairobi area. We also determined that while hookworm was the most common helminth identified in this cohort, the type of helminth infection varied significantly with the location. • Immunology of helminth co‐infection: Helminth infection has been shown to have profound effects on the immune system. Chronic helminth infection leads to a dominant Th2 immune profile, anergy to various antigens, and significant activation of the immune system. These changes suggest that helminth co‐infection may significantly affect the host immune response to HIV‐1 viral replication and control. Such immune dysregulation may also increase HIV co‐receptor expression and result in a cell population more susceptible to HIV infection. In addition to being inducers of Th2 cells, there is evidence that helminth infection can directly suppress the Th1 response. This reduction in the Th1 cytokine response is accompanied by a reduction in virus specific CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL's). Plasma HIV‐1 viral load is directly related to HIV‐1 specific CTL responses in humans and a reduction in CTL response is associated with a more rapid progression of HIV‐1 disease. • Immune Activation: Individuals residing in Africa display high levels of immune activation. Initial studies of Ethiopian immigrants to Israel revealed elevated levels of plasma IgE and IgG as well as increased levels of eosinophilia that were strongly associated with the presence of helminth infection in this population. These individuals were also found to have significantly activated CD4 lymphocytes that correlated with reduced total CD4 number in this cohort. Several authors have suggested that this increased activation may be important in the pathogenesis of HIV‐1 infection. The uncontrolled T cell destruction characteristic of HIV infection is not due to the direct cytopathic effects of the virus but is more likely the result of activation‐induced cell death. Immune activation markers (namely HLA‐DR, Ki‐67 and CD38) have been shown to be more predictive of CD4 decline than plasma HIV‐1 RNA viral load. Treatment of helminth infections can result in reversal of this activated immune state. ‐ Effect of treatment on CD4 count: • Specific Objectives: 2. To determine if intensive treatment of intestinal helminths in HIV‐1 infected adults can reduce markers of clinical disease progression as measured by WHO staging criteria, hospitalization and death. DESIGNS AND METHODOLOGY • Study Site: The study will be conducted at several HIV care sites in Kenya. The University of Washington has a history of collaborative research with the Kenya Medical Research Institute, the University of Nairobi, and Kenyatta National Hospital; all leading academic institutions in Kenya. Enrollment in the randomized clinical trial will take place at up to three sites in Kenya. The determination of sites will be based on ongoing studies of helminth prevalence in Kenya (Walson JL, Otieno P, ongoing) and may include AMREF/CDC Clinic in Kibera, KNH Comprehensive Care Clinic, KEMRI CCC, Homa Bay District Hospital, Kisii District Hospital, Kisumu District Hospital, Kerugoya District Hospital, Machakos District Hospital, Mbagathi District Hospital, Thika District Hospital, and The Comprehensive Care and Research Clinic at Kilifi District Hospital (CGMR‐C). ‐ Study Populations: Individuals who are 18 years or older, who are not currently on antiretroviral therapy and who are interested in study participation will be enrolled after written informed consent is obtained. • Sample Size: Sample size determination ‐ Assuming a power of 90% and alpha of 0.05, we have calculated that 340 individuals would be needed in each arm to detect a difference in CD4 decline of 50 cells/mm3 between the two groups (SD of 200 cells/mm3) over the two years of follow up. Given a maximum expected loss to follow up of approximately 20% over the 24 months of follow up and a maximum of 20% beginning ARV therapy, we will enroll 1200 individuals in the trial to ensure that 340 individuals are available in each arm for analysis. This sample size will also provide greater than 90% power to detect a 0.5 log difference in log10 HIV RNA levels between the treatment arms. ‐ Study design: Specific Aim 1: randomized clinical trial Specific Aim 2: randomized clinical trial ‐ Procedures: Summary: We propose a prospective, randomized, controlled trial of an intensive deworming care package versus standard of care in a cohort of HIV‐1 seropositive adults who do not yet meet criteria for antiretroviral medications. Participants will be randomized into one of two treatment arms. Arm 1 will receive an intensive regimen of anti‐helminthic therapy consisting of albendazole every three months for two years and praziquantel at enrollment and at one year of follow up. Arm 2 will receive symptomatic diagnosis and treatment of helminth infection as is current standard of care in Kenya. The primary objectives of this study are to evaluate changes in CD4 count and HIV‐1 RNA over the two years of follow up in each of the study arms. Adult men and women participating in or referred to the HIV Care and Treatment Clinics at each of the included sites will be offered screening for eligibility. HIV‐1 seropositive individuals with a documented CD4 count greater than 350 cells/mm3 will be considered potentially eligible. Those who agree to participate, are willing and able to provide informed consent, are WHO stage I or II based on clinical exam and history, are 18 years of age or older, have not been treated with worm medication in the previous 4 months and who are not pregnant (based on urine beta‐HCG testing if female) will be offered to participate in this trial. Pregnancy testing will be performed at each study visit (every three months) for all premenopausal women. Women who become pregnant during the course of the study will continue to be followed but will not receive any further study medication during pregnancy if they had been randomized to study arm A. ‐ Clinical Trial: Screening for trial eligibility: At each selected clinical trial study site, HIV‐1 infected individuals who meet inclusion and exclusion criteria will be informed about the ongoing study. A physical examination will be conducted on all prospective clients, and those found to have clinical pallor or signs of WHO Stage III or IV HIV will be excluded from the study and referred for appropriate medical management. Those who meet criteria and wish to participate will be referred to the study staff for possible enrollment. All invited participants will be required to sign written informed consent prior to enrollment. At enrollment, all participants will complete a standardized questionnaire assessing medical and social history and will undergo a complete physical examination. Blood specimens will be collected for full blood count with differential measurement of absolute CD4 count and HIV‐1 RNA levels. A detailed questionnaire will also be administered in order to assess socio‐economic status, living conditions, level of education completed and occupation. This questionnaire will also document potential exposures to helminth infection such as water supply, sanitation facilities, exposure to large bodies of water and type of foot covering used. In addition, a detailed clinical history will also be collected to document any prior illnesses or treatments relevant to HIV‐1 or co‐infections. Detailed information regarding the location of each participant's current residence and any additional residences that they consider as a primary dwelling will also be collected by field workers at each site. Global positioning system information will be collected at the location of each participants site of primary residence to facilitate patient tracing. This information will be stored as well as any other potential contact information available (such as cell phone numbers) in order that participants may be traced for the purposes of the study. After signing informed consent and being enrolled, participants will be randomized into one of two treatment arms. The study biostatistician will generate block randomization codes for the sites. Both the investigators and the participants will remain blinded to study arm allocation until randomization occurs. All enrolled participants will have scheduled study visits every third month for 24 months (enrollment, months 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21 and 24) at the clinic from which they were enrolled. At each follow up visit, a standardized questionnaire designed to assess any change in socio‐demographic variables or clinical history will be performed. A physical examination will also be performed at each visit. Blood will be collected at enrollment, months 6, 12, 18 and 24 for measurement of full blood count with differential and CD4 count. Measurement of HIV‐1 RNA will be collected at enrollment, the 12 month visit and the 24 month visit. All blood will be separated into plasma and PBMC's (peripheral blood mononuclear cells) and stored for future studies. Any future study utilizing stored specimens will obtain approval from both the Kenya Medical Research Institute and the University of Washington Ethical Review Boards. All participants will provide a single stool sample at the final 24 month follow up visit to determine helminth infection status at that time. • Rationale for not screening stool samples at each visit: Participants will not be screened for helminth infection at enrollment or during the course of this study. The only testing for helminth infection status will occur at the final visit. The rationale for this design is principally due to the study objectives. The study is designed to assess the potential benefit of empiric helminth therapy in HIV‐1 infected individual's not yet meeting criteria for initiation of antiretroviral medications. As such, it is important to determine if HIV infected individuals in areas of moderate helminth prevalence (20‐40%) would benefit from a program of empiric deworming as part of their pre‐HAART care package. It is critical that participants be enrolled regardless of helminth infection status in order to determine if empiric therapy should be considered as a useful addition to the care package currently provided to these individuals. Storage of stool samples for evaluation of helminth status following completion of the study is also not feasible for several reasons. Most importantly, there are ethical issues related to the collection of samples (and therefore the potential knowledge of infection status) without providing directed therapy. If helminth status is known (or potentially known), the standard of care in Kenya would change from symptomatic screening and treatment to definitive pathogen directed therapy. This would alter the intervention arms in the current study. In addition, the most common helminth at all of the sites sampled in our previous study was hookworm. Hookworm eggs are fragile and rapidly degrade. None of the currently available techniques will preserve hookworm eggs reliably and so any delayed evaluation of helminth infection status is likely to miss many infections and therefore not provide any additional useful information. • Laboratory: Between ten and twenty millilitres of blood will be drawn each visit where laboratory investigations are being conducted (months 0, 6, 12, 18 and 24). This quantity of blood is being drawn for the following assays: 2. Full Blood Counts with Differential (2 mL) will be assessed at each individual study site. 4. Circulating Anodic Antigen (CAA) (3 mL) will be assessed in the Centre for Clinical Research, KEMRI. • Th1/Th2 Immune Bias: An important immunologic consequence of helminth infection is the polarization of the immune response to a TH2 subset. This immune modulation by helminth species appears to be important in tempering TH1 cell mediated inflammation and subsequent tissue damage to the host. Such modulation may be detrimental to the HIV‐1 infected host by limiting the Th1 immune response that may be important for the control of HIV‐1 replication. The TH2/TH1 response to infection is directly influenced by parasite biology. Helminth infection results in specific nematode‐elicited macrophages (NeMacs) that directly induce naïve T cells to differentiate into Th2 cells. Cytokine mimics produced by some parasites are also able to directly induce Th2 cells. Other non‐protein molecules produced by helminths are able to interact with dendritic cells and induce Th2 cells and Treg cells that produce IL‐10 and directly lead to a Th2 shift in naïve T cells. Helminth co‐infection and clinical HIV‐1 disease progression in resource constrained settings • Effect of treatment on HIV‐1 RNA: Plasma HIV‐1 RNA levels correlate closely with the burden of helminth infection as measured by the number of excreted eggs per gram of stool (p < 0.001). In this same cohort, anti‐helminth therapy leading to clearance of helminth eggs in the stool led to a significant decrease in HIV‐1 plasma viral load (‐0.36 log10) in this cohort. While this effect may appear modest, mathematical modeling suggests that a 0.5 log reduction in HIV‐1 RNA levels would slow the onset of AIDS by 3.5 years and would delay the need for antiretroviral medications by almost a full year. To date, only one randomized controlled trial has been conducted evaluating the effect of treating helminths on markers of HIV‐1 progression. In this small unblinded study conducted in Zimbabwe, individuals with schistosomiasis (both with and without HIV‐1 infection) were randomized to receive praziquantel at inclusion or after a delay of 3 months. The study found that the HIV‐1 infected individuals receiving early treatment of schistosomiasis had no change in plasma HIV‐1 RNA levels compared to an increase in HIV‐1 RNA levels in the delayed treatment group. However, several other observational studies evaluating the effect of treating helminth co‐infection have found that successful eradication of helminths had no effect on plasma HIV‐1 RNA levels or even led to transient increases in viral load. We are currently conducting a systematic review for the Cochrane Library evaluating all of the available data examining the effect of treating helminths of HIV‐1 RNA levels and CD4 counts. • Justification of the Study: It is important to determine if empiric deworming can be beneficial for the millions of pre‐HAART HIV‐1 positive individuals living in helminth endemic areas. Documenting the potential effects of such an intervention on markers of disease progression will serve to inform practical approaches for cost‐effective interventions in resource limited settings. Interval anti‐helminth therapy may be a feasible option in many areas of the world to delay immunosuppression, to enhance the response to antiretroviral therapy or to reduce infectiousness in HIV‐1 infected individuals. In addition, as patients progress to HAART, it is important to determine the ideal timing for helminth eradication. 5. HIV‐1 RNA levels (10 mL) will be quantified at the Kenya Medical Research Institute/Centers for Disease Control, Kenya. • Data Management and Analysis: This study is being carried out at several clinical sites in Kenya. Clinical and laboratory data for each participant will be abstracted from routine clinical data forms into standardized trial files. These data will be entered weekly into a computer using a computerized database designed and maintained by the study investigators. Information will be cross checked for accuracy on a bi‐weekly basis. All data, both hard and soft copy format, will be stored in locked cabinets with limited access by study staff only. Participants will be identified by a unique study ID number and the code linking the study ID to individual identifying information will be kept in a separate secure location by the principal investigator. All data will be collected on preprinted forms and data entered into a software data management program (Teleform SPSS, MS ACCESS or SQL). Data will be collected at enrollment and at each follow up visit on these forms. Following collection, the data forms will be entered into the database as described above. Original data forms will be stored in the study offices with access restricted to study investigators. Following completion of all data collection, the data forms will be archived. At 1‐year following completion of the study, identifiers will be removed from the data. Data will be the property or KEMRI and the University of Washington. Data verification: A data clerk from KEMRI will be employed to hand verify that all data is completed accurately and that the computerized scanned data is comparable to the paper forms. Data will be cleaned by the Principal Investigator, the data manager and data clerk and at that time a second verification of accuracy will be performed. Data Analysis: Aim 1: All analyses will be intent‐to‐treat. To assess the success of randomization we will compare baseline characteristics between the 2 randomization groups using Chi‐square tests for categorical data and Mann‐Whitney U‐tests or t‐tests for continuous data. To determine the effect of anti‐helminth treatment on disease progression markers, we will compare the time to eligibility for ART between the groups and the time to CD4 counts of less than 200 and 350 respectively using Cox regression analysis models. If current treatment guidelines for the initiation of ART change during the course of the study, the analysis plan would incorporate that change in ART eligibility criteria as a date dependent event. In addition, we will compare changes in measurements of mean CD4 count and log10 plasma HIV‐1 RNA in the two study arms using linear mixed effects models or linear regression censoring values after initiation of ART. Aim 2: To determine the effect of anti‐helminth treatment on clinical disease progression markers, we will compare time to changes in WHO Clinical Staging, time to hospitalization, and time to death using Cox regression analysis models. We will also compare the treatment arms for CD4 response to ARVs, and development of IRIS among those who initiate therapy during the course of the trial using regression models. Efficacy assessment The primary measure of efficacy for the randomized clinical trial is the time to ART eligibility and the time to CD4 counts of less than 200 and 350 cells/mm3. Secondary measures of efficacy will include changes in WHO Clinical Staging, development of IRIS, time to hospitalization, time to death, time to initiation of ARVs and CD4 response to ARVs as well as the development of IRIS among those who initiate ARVs. Safety and loss to follow up All participants will be monitored over the course of the trial for adverse events, laboratory abnormalities and HIV related morbidity. Any participant experiencing National Institutes of Health grade 3‐4 toxicity after receipt of anti‐helminthic therapy will be withdrawn from the study. A Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will be convened and will meet every 6 months following the start of enrolment to review safety data including all adverse events, protocol violations and any other reported events. In addition, the DSMB will review interim data when 250 patients have completed 12 months of follow up. Participants failing to meet a clinic appointment or follow up will be identified and have their study file flagged. If a participant fails to return to clinic within two weeks following a missed appointment, a social worker or peer counselor will attempt to contact the participant to encourage attendance using the contact information provided at enrollment. All attempts at contact will be recorded. If a participant desires to be removed from the study or fails to follow up after 3 consecutive attempts by the peer counselors or social workers to encourage follow up, the participant will be considered lost to follow up. It the study staff is unable to trace the patient for a period of 60 days following a missed appointment, the participant will be considered lost to follow up. If a participant dies in the course of the study, a verbal autopsy will be obtained from family members or household contacts where possible for classification of possible cause of death. Participants who meet criteria for the initiation of septrin prophylaxis or ARV's during the course of the study (based on CD4 count or clinical criteria) will be referred for initiation of treatment at the clinic at which they were enrolled. All of the clinics considered as study sites are supported by Government of Kenya and PEPFAR and provide antiretroviral therapy and septrin prophylaxis at no charge to clients who qualify. ‐ Time Schedule: This study will require approximately 3‐4 years for completion. Enrollment will occur over a 6 month period. All participants will be followed for 24 months after enrollment. Thus, it will take approximately 2.5 years to enroll, randomize and complete follow up for all of the patients in the study. An additional 6 months of preparation time will be required to develop the database and prepare each site for study enrollment. Following completion of follow up, we anticipate an additional 6 months will be necessary to complete all laboratory investigations, data analysis, data cleaning and completion of a manuscript. • Ethical Considerations: • Ethical approval: Study approvals will be obtained from the University of Washington and the KEMRI ethical review boards. • Benefits: This study has been designed to address several areas of major public health significance for HIV‐1 infected individuals in resource poor settings. If we are able to show that treatment of helminth co‐infection in HIV‐1 infected individual's delays immunosuppression, millions of HIV infected individuals in resource poor settings may benefit. Participants randomized to the intensive intervention arm will benefit from free treatment and examination given to them. All participants will benefit from intensive clinical and laboratory monitoring. • Voluntary Participation: All subjects will provide written informed consent prior to study enrolment. Consent forms will be made available in Swahili as well as in English. All patients will have the opportunity to have the forms explained to them and to ask questions of the investigator prior to study enrollment. Patients will be informed of their right to withdraw consent at any time. Since the participants will spend extra time to participate in the study, they will receive compensation for transport, but no other compensation will be provided to them. The field sites where patients will be recruited for screening and enrollment are in Kenya. All of these sites are currently receiving support through CDC Kenya using the PEPFAR mechanism. Laboratory procedures will be performed at each clinic site, in Nairobi and in Seattle, Washington. The study will be reviewed by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) at the University of Washington and the Ethical Review Board (ERC) at the Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI). The study will not recruit subjects prior to approval from both the University of Washington IRB and the KEMRI ERC. ‐ Risks: Patients will be informed of all potential risks. The proposed study will involve adult men and women infected with HIV‐1. All participants will be interviewed. Participants may experience discomfort while answering some of the questions regarding socio‐economic status. Participants may also be uncomfortable discussing or providing stool samples for helminth screening. Study staff including social workers and/or peer counselors may contact the participants by telephone or visit the participants in their home if scheduled appointments are missed. These visits will be conducted in a manner designed to protect confidentiality but it is impossible to completely eliminate the risk of further social stigmatization for participants. This study involves serial blood specimen collection at 5 time points over a two year period (enrollment and months 6, 12, 18, and 24). The collection of these samples involves venipuncture which may cause discomfort, pain or bruising. Precautions will be taken to avoid bleeding by immediate application of a pack and pressure at the injection sites. All participants will provide written informed consent prior to screening or enrollment. Any adverse events associated with anti‐helminthic medications will be managed by the appropriate clinic site, and if necessary, hospitalization. The costs of this care will be borne by the study. All clinical information including HIV status that is collected for the purposes of the study will be delinked from any client's identifier. This includes data collected in the clinic and in the laboratory. All data will be entered into a password protected computer with no links to identifiers. The code linking individual patient identifiers to a unique study ID will be kept securely locked in a separate location under control of the study principal investigator. All study files will be accessible only to researchers and will be stored in a locked office when not in use. There may be risks associated with use of the study medications, albendazole and praziquantel: Albendazole is a benzimidazole carbamate derivative with activity against most nematodes and some other worms. Albendazole is thought to inhibit cytoplasmic microtubules in the worm's intestinal tract leading to decreased glucose uptake and depletion of glycogen stores in the worm. Three 400 mg doses of albendazole has efficacy against whipworm, hookworm and roundworm infections, all of which we expect to be prevalent in this cohort. A recent randomized controlled trial of various albendazole dosing regimens showed that a single 400mg dose of albendazole was associated with a significantly lower rate of cure (23%) compared to a three day regimen (67%). In this study, reduction in the number of eggs/gm of feces with a single 400mg dose was 96.8% compared to 99.7% with the three day regimen. Albendazole is minimally absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and has minimal side‐effects. Praziquantel is a heterocyclic prazino‐isoquinoline derivative with significant activity against both cestodes and trematodes. Praziquantel is highly effective against schistosomes in humans and there have been no confirmed cases of resistance reported. Praziquantel is well tolerated and severe adverse reactions are rare. There have been rare cases of increased intracranial pressure during treatment in patients with neurocysticercosis. This is not anticipated to be an issue in Kenya due to the low level of pork consumption in this population and the rarity of Taenia solium. In the study described above, we screened over 1600 individuals for helminths and documented no cases of Taenia solium (Walson J, unpublished data). Praziquantel is contraindicated in pregnancy and all female patients will undergo urine beta‐HCG testing prior to administration. Pregnant or breast feeding women will not receive praziquantel. Patients with obvious clinical signs or symptoms of anaemia, significant diarrhoea or abdominal pain will not be enrolled. Neither routine screening of asymptomatic helminth infection nor empiric anti‐helminth therapy is currently conducted in adults in Kenya. • Confidentiality: Patients will be assigned a study number at enrollment. This number will be used to identify patients for all matters related to data analysis. The forms linking patient names and demographic information to particular ID numbers will be kept locked in a file at the office of the Fellow Investigator. • Expected application of result: We anticipate that the proposed study will help to determine the role that common helminth co‐infections play in HIV‐1 pathogenesis and progression. If empiric deworming is found to significantly slow HIV‐1 disease progression, it may be a cost‐effective and easily implemented strategy to add to the current treatment options in helminth endemic areas. Studies evaluating changes in CD4 counts following therapy for helminth co‐infection have largely failed to find significant differences. The randomized controlled trial noted above did find that patients treated for helminths in the early treatment group (both HIV seropositive and seronegative) had a increase in absolute CD4 counts compared to no change in CD4 counts in the delayed treatment group (p < 0.05). Another study conducted in Ethiopia found that the treatment of helminth infection in a population of co‐infected individuals resulted in a significant increase in absolute CD4 counts (192 versus 279 cells/mm3, p = 0.002). Other studies have shown no significant difference in CD4 decline following anti‐helminth treatment. The systematic review currently in preparation has not found a trend towards an effect on CD4 counts in the available studies though all included studies were of short duration (4 months or less). • Hypothesis: An empiric intensive treatment regimen to eliminate helminths in patients with HIV‐1 may impact markers of disease progression, namely CD4 count and plasma HIV‐1 RNA levels, when compared to current standard of practice in Kenya. • Overall General Objectives: To evaluate the effect of an empiric intensive helminth eradication regimen on HIV‐1 disease progression in a cohort of HIV‐1 infected Kenyan adults who do not meet criteria for highly active antiretroviral therapy. 1. To evaluate the effect of an intensive, empiric deworming regimen on changes in markers of HIV‐1 disease progression, namely time to ART eligibility and time to CD4 count less than 200 and less than 350 cells/mm3 in a cohort of HIV‐1 infected adult Kenyans not meeting criteria for antiretrovirals. 1. CD4 measurement (5 mL) will be assessed by FACSCount or FACSCalibur at the individual study sites or at the KEMRI/University of Washington Flow Laboratory at the Centre for Clinical Research in Nairobi, Kenya. 3. Stool microscopy will be performed by technicians with training and certification in the differentiation and quantification of stool helminth species. Stool will be prepared for examination by wet preparation, Kato‐Katz technique and formol‐ether concentration. Both qualitative and quantitative diagnosis will be made for all helminths identified in stool.",,,,"Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)",,,"CTgov NCT00507221","","","Trial registry record","Albendazole; Coinfection; Communicable Diseases; Disease Progression; HIV Infections; Helminthiasis; Infections; Praziquantel",,"https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-02026595/full",

In this study, we evaluate the topographic relationship between seizure foci based on semiology and electroencephalography with the location of parenchymal neurocysticercotic lesions. Methods: Seizure information, neuroimaging (computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) and electroencephalographic data from three randomized clinical trials of individuals with parenchymal neurocysticercosis and focal seizures were analyzed. Blinded epileptologists defined a potential seizure onset zone and a symptomatogenic zone for each individual based on semiology. The topographic relationship between semiology, either lesion location or areas of perilesional edema on baseline MRI, and electroencephalographic abnormalities were assessed. Results: Fifty‐eight patients with one or two parenchymal neurocysticercotic lesions were included in this study. From them, 50 patients (86%; 95% CI, 75%–93%) showed a clinical‐topography relationship with the potential seizure onset zone, and 44 (76%) also with the symptomatogenic zone. From the eight patients with no topographic relationship, five had focal seizures 30 days before or after the baseline MRI and showed perilesional edema. All of these five patients showed a clinical‐topography relationship between such seizures and an area of perilesional edema, making a total of 55 patients (95%; 95% CI, 85%–99%) with clinical‐topography relationship when perilesional edema is considered. Most patients with focal epileptiform discharges (7/8, 88%) had a topographic association between electroencephalographic focality, the potential seizure onset zone and a cysticercotic lesion. Conclusion: Seizure semiology and focal epileptiform discharges are topographically related to neurocysticercotic lesions in most patients.

No trial has reported a benefit of albendazole in improving seizure outcomes, with the exception of one trial that reported that treatment with albendazole was associated with fewer “seizures with generalization.” Our objective was to examine the effect of albendazole on seizures in more detail, including by seizure type, post‐treatment. Data come from a trial conducted in Ecuador in which patients with symptomatic neurocysticercosis were randomized to receive albendazole 400 mg or placebo twice daily for 8 days, both with prednisone. 178 patients were randomized, with 88 in the albendazole group and 90 in the placebo group. 88% of patients in the albendazole group and 86% of patients in the placebo group completed 12‐months of follow‐up. Overall, fewer patients in the albendazole group had at least one seizure during followup (24% in albendazole group vs. 34% in placebo group), but this difference was not statistically significant (P=0.14). A similar proportion of patients had at least one generalized seizure (11% in albendazole group vs. 12% in placebo group; P=0.77), and at least one focal seizure (22% in albendazole group vs. 25% in placebo group; P=0.65), during followup. On average, there was a lower total number of seizures, generalized seizures, and focal seizures in the albendazole group compared with the placebo group, but this was not statistically significant in unadjusted negative binomial models. After adjusting for potential confounders (age and history of generalized seizures at baseline), the difference in the mean number of generalized seizures was significant (rate ratio 0.24; 95% confidence interval: ‐2.68, ‐0.15; P=0.03). However, the difference in the mean number of total seizures and focal seizures was not statistically significant in adjusted models. In conclusion, albendazole may reduce the frequency of generalized seizures, but more research is needed to determine how albendazole modifies long‐term disease course.","91","5","363‐364","Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)",,"EMBASE 71692421",,,,"Journal article; Conference proceeding","*human; *hygiene; *neurocysticercosis; *patient; *seizure; *society; *tropical medicine; Confidence interval; Disease course; Ecuador; Focal epilepsy; Follow up; Model; Morbidity; Mortality; Neurologic disease; Tonic clonic seizure",,"https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-01056338/full",

It is caused by ingestion of eggs from a tapeworm of genus Taenia. Inflammation, seizures, or neurologic problems may occur in a patient with NCC. Corticosteroids are the current standard of care for NCC patients, but corticosteroids have many side effects. Albendazole is used to treat infections caused by worms; however, it is unclear if its use with the corticosteroid dexamethasone will decrease seizure frequency in NCC patients. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of reducing seizure frequency with a short course of dexamethasone with tapered dosing when given with albendazole, as compared to standard dexamethasone and albendazole treatment, in NCC patients. In this open label study, patients will be randomly assigned to one of two arms. Group I will receive 6 mg dexamethasone daily for 10 days only. Group II will receive 6 mg dexamethasone daily for 10 days, then 8 mg dexamethasone daily for 4 weeks with a 2‐week taper. Both groups will also receive albendazole and omeprazole (a medicine that helps prevent gastroesophageal disease [GERD], a side effect of corticosteroid use).

Background: Antiparasitic treatment improves the prognosis for NCC‐induced seizures. However, patients with high lesion loads are typically denied the possible benefit of cysticidal therapy for fear of complications, and such patients are not represented in trials. We provide proof of concept for treatment with dual‐antiparasitic therapy and corticosteroids in patients with diffuse or calcific NCC. Design/Methods: Written, informed consent was taken and all patients underwent MRI brain to rule out an intraventricular/subarachnoid NCC, hydrocephalus, diffuse cerebral edema and raised intracranial pressure. An ophthalmological examination was done to rule out intra‐ocular cysts. Patients were pre‐treated with intravenous dexamethasone (0.2mg/kg/body weight divided into three doses), and continued to be treated during the anti‐parasitic treatment. Oral antiparasitic drugs were initiated three days later. Albendazole 200mg was started first, and increased to the target dose of 15mg/kg/day with increments of 200mg every three days. Thereafter, praziquantel 300mg was started, and up‐titrated by 300mg every three days to the target dose of 50mg/kg/day. Both were continued for twelve weeks after reaching the desired dose. Thereafter, dexamethasone was tapered and stopped over three weeks. NCCT head and MRI brain were repeated in all patients two weeks after completing treatment. Hemogram, liver and renal function tests were performed every week. Results: Baseline neuroimaging showed multiple viable and calcified parenchymal NCC in all patients. Post‐treatment images revealed near‐complete clearance of both viable and calcific parenchymal NCC in all three patients. Case 1 had approximately 10‐ring lesions and 21‐disc lesions remaining (>400 at baseline), case 2 had around 40 (>400 at baseline) and case 3 had 13 (40 at baseline) remaining lesions. Conclusions: The safety and efficacy of treating patients with diffuse parenchymal or calcific NCC should be tested in a randomised controlled trial.","96","15 SUPPL 1",,"Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)",,"EMBASE 635945833",,,,"Journal article; Conference proceeding","*neurocysticercosis; Adult; Antiparasitic therapy; Body weight; Brain edema; Clinical article; Clinical trial; Conference abstract; Controlled study; Cyst; Drug dose titration; Drug safety; Drug therapy; Female; Human; Hydrocephalus; Informed consent; Intracranial hypertension; Kidney function test; Liver; Male; Neuroimaging; Nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; Proof of concept; Randomized controlled trial",,"https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-02325540/full",

The antihelmintic drug, albendazole, has been shown to hasten the resolution of active cysts in neurocysticercosis. Little is known about the time cysts take to progress through each phase, with or without treatment. METHODS: We reconfigured brain imaging data from patient level to cyst level for 117 patients in a randomized clinical trial of albendazole in which images were taken at baseline, 1, 6, 12 and 24 mo. Applying a multistate model, we modelled the hazard of a cyst evolving to subsequent cyst phases before the next imaging (vs no change). We examined the impact of albendazole treatment overall and by patient and cyst characteristics on the hazard. RESULTS: Albendazole accelerated the evolution from the active to degenerative phase (HR=2.7, 95% CI 1.3 to 6.5) and from the degenerative phase to disappearance (HR=1.9, 95% CI 1.1 to 3.9). Albendazole's impact was stronger for patients who were male, did not have calcified cysts at baseline and who had multiple cysts in different locations. CONCLUSIONS: This research provides a better understanding of where in the cyst trajectory albendazole has the greatest impact.","113","12","781‐788","Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)","PUBMED 31433058","EMBASE 629128549",,,,"Journal article","*Taenia solium; *cyst; *neurocysticercosis; Adult; Albendazole [*therapeutic use]; Animals; Anticestodal Agents [*therapeutic use]; Article; Calcification; Controlled study; Disease Progression; Drug therapy; Female; Human; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Major clinical study; Male; Models, Statistical; Neurocysticercosis [diagnostic imaging, *drug therapy, pathology]; Neuroimaging; Nonhuman; Randomized controlled trial; Taenia solium [*drug effects]; Time Factors","10.1093/trstmh/trz073","https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-01986068/full",

Controversy exists regarding the efficacy of various modalities of treatment. We conducted a randomized prospective trial to evaluate the efficacy of corticosteroids, albendazole, and corticosteroids with albendazole in children with focal seizures and single small enhancing CT lesions. The study population consisted of 133 children with focal seizures of recent onset (< 3 months) and single small enhancing CT lesions who presented to the Neurocysticercosis Clinic of Pediatric Neurology Services at the Advanced Pediatrics Centre, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, an urban teaching and tertiary care hospital in Chandigarh, North India. All children were randomly assigned to receive corticosteroids (group S), albendazole (group A), or both corticosteroids and albendazole (group SA) for 28 days. CT was done at 3 and 6 months after enrollment in the study. Of the 133 patients enrolled, 23 were lost to follow‐up. Of the remaining 110 patients, 38 patients were in group S, 37 in group A, and 35 in group SA. All children were followed up for at least 18 months. Disappearance of the lesion on CT scan was noted in 52.6% of patients in group S, 59.5% in group A, and 62.9% in Group SA (P > .1) at the 3‐month follow‐up. After the 6‐month follow‐up, disappearance of the lesion was noted in 76.3% in group S, 75.7% in group A, and 74.2% in group SA (P > .1). Twenty‐three patients had seizure recurrence while on antiepilepsy drugs: 36.8% of patients in group S, 13.5% in group A, and 11.4% in group SA (P < .05). Seizure recurrence after antiepilepsy drug withdrawal was seen in seven children (three in group S and two each in groups A and SA). In conclusion, there was no significant difference in resolution of CT lesions in the three therapy groups at 3 and 6 months of follow‐up.

Oxfendazole, a veterinary medicine belonging to the benzimidazole family of anthelmintic drugs, has demonstrated substantial activity against the tissue stages of Taenia solium and has potential to be developed as an effective therapy for neurocysticercosis. To accelerate the transition of oxfendazole from veterinary to human use, the pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability of oxfendazole were evaluated in healthy volunteers in this phase 1 first‐in‐human (FIH) study. Seventy subjects were randomly assigned to receive a single oral dose of oxfendazole (0.5, 1, 3, 7.5, 15, 30, or 60 mg oxfendazole/kg body weight) or placebo and were followed for 14 days. Blood and urine samples were collected, and the concentrations of oxfendazole were measured using a validated ultraperformance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry method. The pharmacokinetic parameters of oxfendazole were estimated using noncompartmental analysis. Oxfendazole was rapidly absorbed with a mean plasma half‐life ranging from 8.5 to 11 h. The renal excretion of oxfendazole was minimal. Oxfendazole exhibited significant nonlinear pharmacokinetics with less than dose‐proportional increases in exposure after single oral doses of 0.5 mg/kg to 60 mg/kg. This nonlinearity of oxfendazole is likely due to the dose‐dependent decrease in bioavailability that is caused by its low solubility. Oxfendazole was found to be well tolerated in this study at different escalating doses without any serious adverse events (AEs) or deaths. There were no significant differences in the distributions of hematology, biochemistry, or urine parameters between oxfendazole and placebo recipients.

The observation in small uncontrolled randomized trials in children that short‐course therapy (1 week) is as effective as the conventional regimen (4weeks) must be tested. OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy of 1 and 4 weeks of albendazole therapy in children with single small enhancing computed tomographic lesion (SSECTL). STUDY DESIGN: An open‐labeled, randomized, clinical trial. MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred twenty children with SSECTLs presenting with seizure. INTERVENTION: The subjects were assigned to two groups using random tables: group A (n=58) received albendazole for 1 week and group B (n=62) for 4 weeks. All the subjects were followed up for 6 months. RESULTS: The proportions of subjects with complete resolution of lesion in the two groups were similar (group A 63.8% versus group B 51.6%). The proportion of subjects in the two groups in whom the lesion calcified on follow up (group A 19% versus group B 24.2%) also did not differ significantly. The incidence of seizure recurrence during the 6‐month follow‐up period was also similar in both the groups (group A 9.6% versus group B 3.4%, P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: One week of albendazole therapy is as effective as 4 weeks of therapy in children with SSECTLs.","58","4","560‐564","Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)","PUBMED 20739792",,,,,"Journal article","Albendazole [*therapeutic use]; Child; Child, Preschool; Double‐Blind Method; Female; Follow‐Up Studies; Humans; Infant; Male; Retrospective Studies; Seizures [*diagnosis, *drug therapy]; Statistics, Nonparametric; Time Factors; Tomography, X‐Ray Computed [*adverse effects]; Treatment Outcome; Tubulin Modulators [*therapeutic use]","10.4103/0028-3886.68677","https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-00761905/full","Cochrane Nordic; Epilepsy; HS-HANDSRCH; Infectious Diseases"
