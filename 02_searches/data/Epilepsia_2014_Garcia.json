  "First_Author": "Garcia, H. H.",
  "Year": "2014",
  "Country": "Peru",
  "Study_Design": "Randomized Open-label Trial",
  "Risk_of_Bias": "Moderate",
  "Diagnostic_Criteria": "Positive Western Blot, MRI/CT with <20 viable cysts",
  "Total_Sample_Size": "64",
  "Treatment_Group_N": "32",
  "Control_Group_N": "32",
  "Age_Mean_SD": "31.4 (Conventional) / 30.1 (Enhanced)",
  "Male_Percentage": "69% (Conventional) / 66% (Enhanced)",
  "Female_Percentage": "31% (Conventional) / 34% (Enhanced)",
  "Other_Demographics": "History of seizures <10 years, no major comorbidities",
  "Headache_Percentage": "84% (Conventional), 75% (Enhanced)",
  "Focal_Seizures_Percentage": "Partial Seizures: Conventional 69%, Enhanced 47%",
  "Other_Symptoms": "Intracranial hypertension, memory loss, somnolence",
  "Treatment_Type": "Albendazole + Dexamethasone",
  "Albendazole_Dose": "15 mg/kg/day for 14 days",
  "Treatment_Duration_Days": "14 (Albendazole), 28 (Dexamethasone Enhanced)",
  "Number_of_Cycles": "1",
  "Cycle_Interval_Days": "Not applicable",
  "Praziquantel_Dose": "Not used",
  "Corticosteroid_Type": "Dexamethasone, with enhanced taper",
  "Antiepileptic_Drug": "Carbamazepine, Phenytoin (levels monitored)",
  "Follow_up_Duration_Months": "12",
  "Imaging_Schedule": "MRI at baseline, day 180 and day 360",
  "Complete_Resolution_Percentage": "35.5% (Conventional), 45.2% (Enhanced) by day 180",
  "Partial_Resolution_Percentage": "53.7% cyst reduction (Conventional), 43.4% (Enhanced)",
  "No_Change_Percentage": "Not reported",
  "Seizure_Reduction_Percentage": "Overall reduction in seizure days for Enhanced (144 Conventional vs. 31 Enhanced, p=0.007)",
  "Elevated_Liver_Enzymes_Percentage": "Conventional: 3 subjects, Enhanced: 6 subjects",
  "Other_AE": "Insomnia, weight gain, increased glucose (no significant differences)",
  "Comments": "Enhanced regimen showed significant reduction in seizures during days 1-21 (p=0.014), with fewer adverse events and similar efficacy in cyst reduction. Overall results suggest enhanced steroid dosing can lower seizure incidence without impacting cyst resolution.",
