  "Country": "India",
  "Study_Design": "Prospective clinical trial with alternate allocation",
  "Risk_of_Bias": "Moderate - alternate allocation rather than true randomization",
  "Diagnostic_Criteria": "Single small (<20mm) enhancing CT lesion with new onset seizures <2 weeks duration",
  "Total_Sample_Size": "43",
  "Treatment_Group_N": "23",
  "Control_Group_N": "20",
  "Age_Mean_SD": "24 ± 6 years (range 6-60)",
  "Male_Percentage": "65.1 (28/43)",
  "Female_Percentage": "34.9 (15/43)",
  "Other_Demographics": "65% aged 5-25 years",
  "Headache_Percentage": "39.5 (17/43) had postictal headache",
  "Focal_Seizures_Percentage": "72.1 (31/43) had partial seizures with or without generalization",
  "Other_Symptoms": "Postictal weakness (Todd's palsy) in 5 patients",
  "Treatment_Type": "Albendazole vs no cysticidal therapy",
  "Albendazole_Dose": "15 mg/kg/day in two divided doses",
  "Treatment_Duration_Days": "14",
  "Number_of_Cycles": "1",
  "Cycle_Interval_Days": "Not applicable",
  "Praziquantel_Dose": "Not used",
  "Corticosteroid_Type": "No steroids used",
  "Antiepileptic_Drug": "Carbamazepine 15 mg/kg/day or phenytoin 5 mg/kg/day",
  "Follow_up_Duration_Months": "Mean 7.06 ± 1.16",
  "Imaging_Schedule": "At diagnosis, 4 weeks, 3 months and study completion",
  "Complete_Resolution_Percentage": "95.6% (22/23) albendazole group vs 70% (14/20) control at study completion",
  "Partial_Resolution_Percentage": "Not directly specified",
  "No_Change_Percentage": "4.4% (1/23) albendazole group vs 30% (6/20) control",
  "Seizure_Reduction_Percentage": "Seizure recurrence in 7% albendazole group vs 9.3% control (p=0.47)",
  "Elevated_Liver_Enzymes_Percentage": "Not reported",
  "Other_AE": "Not specifically reported",
  "Comments": "Albendazole hastened resolution of lesions when given early (within 2 weeks of symptoms). Better radiological resolution in treatment group (p=0.03) but no significant difference in seizure recurrence or calcification.",
